<h2 class="chap1">
CHAPTER I.
<br />
<span class="s08">MY UNCLE, THE MAJOR.</span>
</h2>

<p>
He who sets himself down to write of his
own deeds in order that future generations
may know exactly what part he bore in
freeing the colonies from the burdens put
upon them by a wicked king, must have
some other excuse, or reason, than that of
self-glorification.
</p>

<p>
Some such idea as set down above has
been in my mind from the moment Percy
Sumter&mdash;meaning my brother&mdash;urged that
I make a record of what we did while serving
under General Francis Marion, that
ardent patriot and true soldier, who was
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_2' name='Page_2'>[2]</a></span>
willing to make of himself a cripple rather
than indulge in strong drink.
</p>

<p>
I question if there be in the Carolinas
any one who does not know full well the
story of that night in Charleston, when,
the door being locked upon him in order
that he might be forced to drink, General
Marion&mdash;then only a colonel&mdash;leaped from
the window, thereby dislocating his ankle,
rather than indulge in a carousal which to
him was unseemly and ungentlemanly.
</p>

<p>
This is but a lame beginning to what it
is intended I shall tell regarding those
days when we two lads, Percy and myself,
did, as it has pleased many to say, the
work of men in the struggle against foreign
rule; yet however crude it may appear to
those better versed in the use of the pen,
it is the best I can do. My brother and
myself went into General Marion's camp
before our fourteenth birthday, and since
that time have studied the art of warfare
instead of letters, which fact is due to the
troublous times rather than our own inclination,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_3' name='Page_3'>[3]</a></span>
for my desire ever was to improve
my mind until I should be at least
on equal terms with those lads who were
more favored as to country.
</p>

<p>
First let me set down that of which we
two&mdash;meaning Percy and myself&mdash;can
honestly claim without fear of being called
boastful.
</p>

<p>
Our mother was sister to those noble
gentlemen, John, William, Gavin, James
and Robert James, who one and all devoted
their fortunes and their lives to the cause
of the independence of the Carolinas. She
married a Sumter, who died while yet we
twins were in the cradle, and, therefore, we
were come to look upon ourselves as true
members of the James family, rather than
Sumters, priding ourselves upon that which
every true Carolinian is ready to declare,
that "he who rightfully bears the name
of James is always ready for the foe, the
first in attack and the last in retreat."
</p>

<p>
I am coming to the beginning of my
story in a halting, and what may seem a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_4' name='Page_4'>[4]</a></span>
boastful, fashion, yet to my mind there is
no other way of telling plainly what Percy
and I were so fortunate as to accomplish
under General Marion, than that of explaining
why it was we two lads, less than fourteen
years of age, should have been given
such opportunities.
</p>

<p>
Now I will write particularly of my
uncle, the major, in order that it may be
further understood how we lads came to
be known as scouts in the service of the
"Swamp Fox," and while so doing much
which is already well-known must be
repeated.
</p>

<p>
When the city of Charleston was captured
by the British, thousands of Carolinians
who were true to the cause of independence
voluntarily made of themselves exiles, despairing
of being able to wrest their native
colonies from the hands of the king, and
willing to assist those in the north whose
possibilities seemed bright.
</p>

<p>
To the men who were left at home, the
proclamation of Sir Henry Clinton, offering
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_5' name='Page_5'>[5]</a></span>
pardon to the inhabitants and a reinstatement
of all their rights, seemed most
honest.
</p>

<p>
When, however, Sir Henry's second decree
was issued early in August, in the year
1780, declaring that we who accepted "pardon"
must take up arms against those of
the northern colonies who were yet holding
their own against oppression, the condition
of affairs seemed suddenly to have changed,
and the gentlemen of the Carolinas asked
themselves how these two proclamations
could bear relationship.
</p>

<p>
Such question could only be answered by
those high in authority under the king, and
that the matter might be made plain, the
people of Williamsburg, in the colony of
South Carolina, chose my uncle, Major John
James, to represent them in asking for an
explanation.
</p>

<p>
The nearest post was at Georgetown, and
the commandant one Captain Ardesoif.
</p>

<p>
To this officer my uncle presented himself
with the question as to what might be
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_6' name='Page_6'>[6]</a></span>
meant by the demand that the people of
South Carolina "submit themselves to the
king," and if, after having done so to the
satisfaction of his majesty, they would be
allowed to remain at their homes.
</p>

<p>
The British captain was one who looked
upon the colonists generally as slaves who
should be whipped into subjection, rather
than men who were able and willing to
defend their lives, and taking such view of
the Carolinians, he made answer much in
this fashion:
</p>

<p>
"His majesty offers you a free pardon,
of which you are undeserving, for you all
ought to be hanged: but it is only on condition
that you take up arms in his
cause."
</p>

<p>
Had this redcoated captain known my
uncle better, he might have selected his
words with greater wisdom; but, unacquainted
with our family, he could have
made no greater mistake, and proud am I
to set down that which I know to be my
uncle's answer:
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_7' name='Page_7'>[7]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"Sir, the people whom I am come to
represent will scarcely submit to such
condition."
</p>

<p>
Then it was that Captain Ardesoif flew
into a passion, giving no heed to the possibility
that it might be dangerous to allow
his tongue free rein.
</p>

<p>
"Represent!" he cried in a fury. "You
insolent rebel, if you dare speak in such
language I will have you hung up at the
yard-arm," and the redcoated captain pointed
to his ship, which lay in the harbor.
</p>

<p>
I had never set myself down as a member
of the James family if such words had
been allowed to pass unnoticed, but those
who know my uncle could have told the
captain that he was most unwise in attempting
to <i>force</i> us into any agreement.
</p>

<p>
The king's officer was armed, and my
uncle, clad in a garb such as is worn by
us of Williamsburg, carried no weapons.
This fact, however, had no weight with
Major James.
</p>

<p>
Seizing the chair upon which he sat he
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_8' name='Page_8'>[8]</a></span>
rushed upon the insolent Britisher, striking
him senseless with a single blow, and then
making his escape at once, for the king's
soldiers were there in force, he mounted
his horse and fled from the town.
</p>

<p>
All possibility that we of Williamsburg
would "submit" had vanished, and within
four and twenty hours came the enrolment
of that body of true gentlemen and
noble soldiers who were afterward known,
and the memory of whom will live so long
as the history of these colonies are told, as
"Marion's Brigade."
</p>

<p>
It was the major, as a matter of course,
who took command of these volunteers,
and they were divided into four companies,
each under a captain.
</p>

<p>
The first was led by William M'Cottry;
Henry Mouzon had command of the
second. John of the Lake&mdash;another branch
of the James family, and an uncle to the
major&mdash;was captain of the third, while
John McCauley stood at the head of the
fourth division.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_9' name='Page_9'>[9]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
These gentlemen, who had come together
within less than four and twenty hours
after my uncle's interview with the representative
of his majesty at Georgetown
were all residents of the district of
Williamsburg, and were rendezvoused
on the banks of Lynch's Creek nearby
where it joins the Great Pedee River within
less than two miles of my mother's home.
</p>

<p>
All this is set down by way of explanation,
so that whosoever in the days
to come shall read what I am so lamely doing,
may understand how it chanced that
we two lads played so important a part&mdash;for
circumstances put it in our way to
do good work&mdash;in the struggle which finally
freed the Carolinas, as well as the other colonies
of America, from the burdens which
the king put upon them.
</p>

<p>
Percy and I had seen somewhat of warfare,
or at least we believed we had, and
watched keenly the movements of this brigade
which my uncle commanded, expecting
that such deeds of valor would be performed
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_10' name='Page_10'>[10]</a></span>
by him and his soldiers as must
give new impetus to the Cause throughout
all the colonies.
</p>

<p>
Then, to our great surprise, we learned
that General Marion was appointed chief
over the forces raised in the Williamsburg
district, and our hearts were filled with
disappointment because it appeared to us
that thereby had Major James lost the opportunity
to show himself the valiant and
skillful officer we believed him to be.
</p>

<p>
As a matter of course we had heard
much regarding this soldier who leaped
out of a window at the expense of breaking
his bones, rather than join a party of
gentlemen in their drinking, and were
burning with curiosity, which as I have
said, was mixed with deep disappointment,
to know what kind of an appearance he
might present.
</p>

<p>
The men of the command were by no
means as captious regarding him as we
two nephews of the man whom we believed
to be the rightful commander.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_11' name='Page_11'>[11]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Those Carolinians who took part in the
defense of Charleston knew him to be a
brave colonel, and expected much of him
as a general; but we lads were more than
disappointed in the appearance of the
soldier who had already made for himself
a worthy name.
</p>

<p>
We saw a small, swarthy gentleman,
walking with a decided limp, wearing a
round-bodied, crimson jacket, and, perched
upon his head was a leathern cap ornamented
with a silver crescent on which
were inscribed the words "liberty or
death."
</p>

<p>
While we were not disposed to compare
the king's soldiers with our own brave men
to the disparagement of the latter, we had
seen officers from many countries, and had
rather more than a vague idea of what
a uniform should be. Therefore this grotesque
costume&mdash;for I can call it by no
other name&mdash;impressed us unfavorably,
although in a very few days we came to
learn better than ever before that something
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_12' name='Page_12'>[12]</a></span>
more than clothes are needed to
make the man.
</p>

<p>
When General Marion arrived at Lynch's
Creek on the 12th of August, the men
of Williamsburg had a military organization
numbering, perhaps, four hundred,
and not a man that could boast of a complete
equipment.
</p>

<p>
Our Carolinians were armed with whatsoever
weapons they owned, some carrying
shot-guns and others muskets, while
M'Cottry's company were provided with
small-bore rifles. Each man had, perhaps,
his horn filled with powder; but no more
than that, and, as I have heard my uncle
say time and time again, when the brigade
first went into camp there was not
of ammunition sufficient to sustain an engagement
lasting half an hour.
</p>

<p>
The variety of missiles was as great as
that of weapons. A few had muskets or
rifle balls which they themselves had
molded; others carried buck-shot, and
some were provided only with bird-shot.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_13' name='Page_13'>[13]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
As for swords, bayonets and pikes, we
had none, and the first order which General
Marion issued after arriving at
Lynch's Creek, caused me to have a
higher opinion of him than I had at first
believed would be possible.
</p>

<p>
Word was given that the force disperse
in squads of from five to a dozen men,
and set about sacking the saw mills in the
immediate vicinity. Nothing was to be
taken away from them save the saws,
and these it was proposed should be beaten
by the blacksmiths of the district into
sabres.
</p>

<p>
Now in such work as this two lads like
Percy and myself could do as much as men,
and, without asking the privilege of volunteering,
we set out, forming an "independent
command of two," as Percy put it, bound
for a certain mill owned by one Pingree,
who had announced again and again that
a Carolinian who would set himself in defiance
against the king deserved nothing
better than hanging.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_14' name='Page_14'>[14]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
It was no brave adventure which we
started upon, and yet it led to our being
brought into direct, and I might almost say
close, contact with General Marion himself.
</p>

<p>
There was little need that we two lads
should ask permission from our mother to
join in the work of saw gathering, for the
major was at the head of the family in
good truth, and whatsoever he might do,
was, in the opinion of even the most distant
relatives, worthy of being copied.
</p>

<p>
It was only necessary Percy and I should
announce that we counted on aiding the
major so far as might be possible, and our
mother at once saw that we were provided
with such amount of provisions as would
serve to keep hunger at bay during at least
two days.
</p>

<p>
Perhaps my uncle might have objected
to the plan had he been informed of it; but
such information we were not minded to
give lest the venture should be a failure,
and we become a butt for his mirth.
</p>

<p>
Therefore it was we set out secretly, so
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_15' name='Page_15'>[15]</a></span>
to speak, armed with the rifles which during
no less than half a dozen years had
served us in all the turkey-hunts and deer-stalking
parties we were allowed to join.
</p>

<p>
Because this venture of ours was not
important, save in what it led up to, there
is no reason why I should use many words
in the telling of it. Suffice it to say that
after a tramp of ten miles or more, when we
had crossed the Pedee River at Port's Ferry
and were at Pingree's Mills, we learned,
greatly to our surprise and considerably
to our fear, that we should not be allowed
to dismantle the building.
</p>

<p>
There we were met by a lad of our acquaintance
whose home was in Kingstree.
Samuel Lee was the name of this fellow,
with whom we had had little intercourse
because of his associating much with the
king's soldiers; there had never been any
bad blood between us, but we held aloof
from him, and now I was less inclined than
ever to give him my confidence.
</p>

<p>
He was curious to know what brought us
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_16' name='Page_16'>[16]</a></span>
so far from home, and on our part we wondered
what had led him out of the district.
</p>

<p>
Neither Percy nor I had any particular
reason to fear Sam Lee; yet instinctively
we closed our mouths on his approach,
which was at the very moment when we
were about to wrench the saws from the
fastenings, and awaited his speech.
</p>

<p>
"What are you two hunting?" he asked
with an unwarranted assumption of
familiarity which Percy at once resented
by closing his mouth closely, while I, little
dreaming what information it was possible
for him to give, replied in a tone intended
to repel his advances:
</p>

<p>
"Any game which comes our way is not
unwelcome."
</p>

<p>
"Are you expecting to find fur or feather
in Pingree's Mill?"
</p>

<p>
I was tempted to reply roughly; but
without knowing why it should be done, I
put a curb upon my tongue and spoke him
fairly, even against my inclination.
</p>

<p>
"When one has traveled far under such
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_17' name='Page_17'>[17]</a></span>
a blazing sun as shines to-day, any shelter
from the heat is grateful."
</p>

<p>
"And may at the same time be dangerous
for some lads," he said in a tone which
caused me to believe it was within his
power to give some information of value
to us.
</p>

<p>
"Why should it be dangerous for some,
and not for others?" I asked.
</p>

<p>
"Because all who live in the Williamsburg
district do not boast of their relationship
to the James family, great though it
may be."
</p>

<p>
Now was I certain he had it in his mind
to do us a mischief, and was capable of
carrying it out, else the cowardly lad who
called himself a Loyalist would never have
spoken so boldly.
</p>

<p>
There was a similar thought in Percy's
mind, as I understood from the meaning
look he gave me, and then I was resolved
to know all Sam Lee could tell.
</p>

<p>
By way of provoking him to further
speech I said boastingly:
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_18' name='Page_18'>[18]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"If you know of another family hereabout
who have greater reason to be proud
of its members, than ours, I would like
much to hear the name."
</p>

<p>
"Those who are wrapped up in their own
conceit fail oftentimes of seeing the good
which is in others, and I have heard it said
that not one of the James tribe would admit
that even the king was higher in position
than he."
</p>

<p>
"You might have heard it said with
equal truth that not a James, or a true
Carolinian would admit that such a king
as now claims the right to rule over us,
was even our equal." Percy replied hotly,
and this seditious remark had the effect
which I was hoping to bring about.
</p>

<p>
It stirred Sam Lee to anger, and he
cried menacingly, but taking good care
meanwhile to move off at a safe distance.
</p>

<p>
"Before many days you will learn that
the James family cannot even take care
of themselves!"
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_19' name='Page_19'>[19]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"But who shall teach us that lesson?"
Percy asked with a sneer.
</p>

<p>
"No less a man than Major Gainey himself."
</p>

<p>
"And how can he, who is now in
Charleston, teach us so odd and sudden a
lesson?"
</p>

<p>
"The major is at Britton's Neck!" Sam
cried triumphantly. "In command of a
body of Loyalists so large that the people
of Williamsburg will soon be on their
knees begging protection from the king's
troops."
</p>

<p>
"He will need have more Tories at his
back to do that, than have ever been found
in the Carolinas," Percy cried, now almost
boiling with rage.
</p>

<p>
"It may be that you Sumter lads, who
hang to the skirts of Major James because
of the great deeds he claims to be able to
perform, have yet much to learn regarding
the Loyalists of the Carolinas! What
say you to two thousand well-armed and
well-drilled men?"
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_20' name='Page_20'>[20]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"Two thousand?" Percy repeated with
a laugh of scorn. "You know full well,
Sam Lee, that such a number of Tories
cannot be gathered in these colonies."
</p>

<p>
"There is at this moment, ready to
march upon your wonderful General
Marion, near to that number of men, and
before a week has passed every James
around Williamsburg will be in custody of
the king's forces."
</p>

<p>
"If all you say be true, and I doubt seven-eighths
of it, why are you so far afield from
those of your kidney? After all that has
taken place in this colony, a Tory would
do well to have a care over his steps lest
he blunder into evil," and now it was that
I began to lose control over my temper.
</p>

<p>
"It is you who are blundering, Bob
Sumter, for I have but to raise my voice
and an hundred soldiers will answer me."
</p>

<p>
Percy laughed derisively; but I am willing
to confess that there was something
very like timorousness in my heart as the
Tory lad spoke, for I knew full well he had
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_21' name='Page_21'>[21]</a></span>
not dared say so much unless friends were
close at hand.
</p>

<p>
Now I felt positive there were no such
number of Tories under Major Gainey as
Sam Lee had said, yet was I equally certain
there must be a strong gathering in the
neighborhood, and he would have been a
dull lad indeed who could not realize how
important it was that my uncle, the major,
have immediate information regarding the
assembly.
</p>

<p>
Once this fact had gained lodgment in
my mind I was burning with anxiety to
retrace my steps.
</p>

<p>
There was no longer any desire in us to
bring back a goodly store of saws that our
neighbors might praise us for having been
industrious.
</p>

<p>
There remained only the question of
leaving Sam Lee as quickly as might be,
without arousing his suspicions as to where
we were going.
</p>

<p>
It was not a simple matter, however, to
give him the slip.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_22' name='Page_22'>[22]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
He must have read in my face that his
information disturbed me, and, like a fool
who believes that by multiplying words
he gives yet further weight to his argument,
the fellow launched forth in praises
of this vast body of Tories who were to
work us of Williamsburg so much injury.
</p>

<p>
My impatience increased until it seemed
no longer possible to stand there listening
to what was little less than threats, and,
seizing Percy by the hand lest in his anger
he should leap upon the braggart, I said
with so much of friendliness as could be
assumed:
</p>

<p>
"As you have said, Master Lee, we are
far from home, and it behooves us to retrace
our steps before sunset, more particularly
if there are so many traitors to their
country in this vicinity as you would have
us believe. We bid you good-day, and trust
that the time may speedily come when it
will not be so simple a matter to part
company."
</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i032" id="i032"></a>
<img src="images/i-032.jpg" width="338" height="550" alt="" />
<p class="caption">As the Tory spoke, Percy leaped upon him.&mdash;<a href="#Page_28">Page 28</a>
</p>
</div>

<p>
"You may be certain that day is near at
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_24' name='Page_24'>[24]</a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_23' name='Page_23'></a></span>
hand," he replied in a menacing tone.
"Before a week has passed I venture to
predict the king's enemies in Williamsburg
will be under close guard, powerless to say
when they will go or come."
</p>

<p>
As the Tory spoke Percy wrenched himself
free from my grasp, and leaped upon
him.
</p>

<p>
To flog such a coward as Sam Lee was a
simple matter, and I stepped aside lest it
should afterward be said that two of us
set upon one, thinking that while it might
be imprudent for my brother to mete out
the punishment which was merited, it was
a duty which could not with honor be
avoided.
</p>

<p>
Sam shrieked lustily, and before he had
received half a dozen well-aimed blows I
heard a great trampling in the underbrush;
then came into view two score or more of
men in the king's uniform, and for an instant
I believed that the Tory's threat was
about to be made good.
</p>

<h2>
CHAPTER II.<br />
<span class="s08">GENERAL MARION.</span></h2>

<p>
Not until I had warned him, was Percy
aware of the danger which menaced.
</p>

<p>
Intent only upon the task which he set
himself, with a view of performing it in
the shortest possible space of time, the lad
gave no heed to anything else, and but for
the fact of my being on watch, so to
speak, I believe of a verity he would have
been taken prisoner.
</p>

<p>
Even as it was, he did not cease his
labors until the Tory crew were come
within fifty yards of him, and then with
one vigorous, well-directed blow by way
of parting, Percy took to his heels.
</p>

<p>
I had at that moment started toward
him, believing the lad was minded to
give battle even though the odds were
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_25' name='Page_25'>[25]</a></span>
twenty to one, for the James family of
Williamsburg are not given to counting
cost when the chances are heavily against
them.
</p>

<p>
Then, seeing what was his inclination,
I wheeled about almost at the very instant
when the Tories sent a volley of bullets
after us, and I do truly believe there was
a blush of shame upon my cheek that
men of Carolina should show themselves
such wretched marksmen, for not a missile
hit us, although the range could not
have been above forty yards.
</p>

<p>
We were not minded to run in the open
where the traitors might practise at
shooting, with us as targets; but, bearing
sharply to the left, we plunged into the
thicket, where I felt certain such as those
who would consort with Sam Lee could
not come up with us.
</p>

<p>
Percy, whose blood had been warmed by
the punishment given the young Tory,
burned with a desire to halt and give
battle.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_26' name='Page_26'>[26]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"It would be folly for us to set ourselves
against such odds when no benefit may
be derived from the battle," I said, speaking
as we ran.
</p>

<p>
"If the odds are great, so much more
thorough the lesson, and these skulking
traitors surely need a check just now,
when the fortunes of war seem to be in
their favor."
</p>

<p>
"Ay, but it is not for us to play the
schoolmaster with less than half a horn
of powder and five bullets," I replied, checking
back the mirth which came upon me
when the dear lad spoke of making an
attack almost empty-handed upon the
Tories of Williamsburg.
</p>

<p>
It was such a suggestion as might be
expected from a James of the Carolinas,
and certain it is Percy would have halted
with a smile upon his face and a sense
of deepest satisfaction in his heart, even
though by so doing we brought ourselves
face to face with death.
</p>

<p>
He always looked upon me as a leader,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_27' name='Page_27'>[27]</a></span>
however, and now it was well he had been
accustomed to do so, otherwise I doubt if
we should ever have left that place alive.
</p>

<p>
"Since we must perforce return empty-handed,
for there are no other mills to be
sacked in this neighborhood, I would give
much for the privilege of showing those
fellows how to shoot, else will this day be
wasted," he said after a pause.
</p>

<p>
"In that you are making a mistake, lad.
The day would surely be spent in vain if
yonder band of Tories suffer no greater loss
of numbers than we could inflict; but by
running away now it may be possible to
crush out the whole nest."
</p>

<p>
"Then you have some plan in mind?"
he cried eagerly.
</p>

<p>
"No more than this: After the reverses
which have come to our people at Charleston
something in the nature of success is
necessary to revive the faint-hearted, and
it can readily be done if we carry to General
Marion word of what has been done. Unless
I am much mistaken in our commander,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_28' name='Page_28'>[28]</a></span>
we shall soon have ample opportunity of
showing these traitors how to shoot."
</p>

<p>
Now, and for the first time, Percy understood
what might be the result of this day's
failure, so far as we were concerned, to secure
material for sabres.
</p>

<p>
It was no longer necessary for me to
urge him to make greater speed in the
retreat.
</p>

<p>
Halting only when forced to do so that
we might regain breath, and giving no
thought whatsoever to fatigue, the race
was ended in a little more than two hours,
when we stood before our uncle, the major,
telling him of what we had seen at Pingree's
Mill.
</p>

<p>
"It is a fortunate chance for us, lads,"
he said in a tone of satisfaction. "Scantily
equipped as this force is, we need something
to inflame the courage of our men."
</p>

<p>
"Sam Lee would have had us believe
there were two thousand Tories nearabout,
sir," I ventured to suggest, and the major
looked at me searchingly for an instant.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_29' name='Page_29'>[29]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"Do the odds make you timorous, lad?"
</p>

<p>
"Not so, sir. But that I believed it necessary
General Marion should know of the
encampment, Percy and I would have given
them so much of a lesson as might be possible
with five bullets. In fact, I found it
somewhat difficult to force him along with
me, so much averse was he to running
away."
</p>

<p>
My uncle's stern, questioning gaze disappeared
on the instant, and gripping both
of us lads by the hands, he said in a most
friendly tone:
</p>

<p>
"I had no reason whatsoever to question
your courage, for you are members of our
family; yet for the merest fraction of time
it seemed as if you might perchance show
the white feather when our enemies were
in such force. Come with me to the general,
and you shall see whether any account
be taken of numbers, for now has the Cause
fallen into such sore straits that every man
who holds to it must consider himself equal
to a dozen of the king's minions."
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_30' name='Page_30'>[30]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Our brigade was set down, rather than
encamped, in the woods; there were no
shelters other than such as the men made
for themselves with pine boughs, and the
command bore but little semblance to a
military organization.
</p>

<p>
Therefore it was that we were not
troubled to gain audience with the commander.
</p>

<p>
The crimson jacket could be seen a long
distance away under a huge live-oak tree,
nearby where were three or four men building
a camp-fire, and toward that gleaming
spot of color we made our way.
</p>

<p>
"I would introduce to you two members
of my family, sons of the Widow Sumter,"
the major said as he saluted, and I was
surprised at the change which passed over
that serious, almost gloomy-looking face
when a friendly expression came into his
eyes.
</p>

<p>
It was as if he had thrown off the mask,
and shown us a countenance almost the opposite
to that which we had previously seen.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_31' name='Page_31'>[31]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Nothing more was needed to tell me, that
now indeed, we had a leader who was worthy
to supersede my uncle.
</p>

<p>
"It pleasures me to meet with those who
are akin to such a true patriot as Major
James," the general said most courteously,
and one needs remember that he was speaking
to two lads, in order to understand how
much such words meant.
</p>

<p>
"I can answer for it they will be true
to any trust you may repose in them," my
uncle said, and Percy gripped me by the
hand that I might understand how well
pleased he was at such words of praise.
"It was not simply to bring the lads to
your notice that I have thus introduced
them, General; they have information of
greatest importance."
</p>

<p>
General Marion turned toward us inquiringly,
and in as few words as might
be I told him of the encounter.
</p>

<p>
"A force of two thousand?" he said half
to himself, and added as he looked me full
in the eye. "Can you depend upon the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_32' name='Page_32'>[32]</a></span>
truthfulness of the lad who made the
boast?"
</p>

<p>
"Indeed we cannot, sir. I would have
been inclined to doubt the entire story,
had not forty or more appeared in response
to Sam Lee's cries for help."
</p>

<p>
"Are you positive he spoke of Major
Gainey as being in command?"
</p>

<p>
"Ay, sir; I remember well the name."
</p>

<p>
"Are you lads enlisted with this force?"
</p>

<p>
Instead of answering the question I
looked toward my uncle, and he replied
without hesitation:
</p>

<p>
"They are, General, if it please you to
accept lads as young as they."
</p>

<p>
"It is the will and the courage, rather
than the age, which we need, Major James,
and unless I have made a mistake in reading
their faces, these sons of the Widow
Sumter may do men's work in the task
which is set them."
</p>

<p>
Percy and I made our best salute, as can
well be fancied and from that moment
counted ourselves as being enlisted under
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_33' name='Page_33'>[33]</a></span>
that true general and valiant soldier, to
whom the butcher Tarleton gave the name
of "Swamp Fox."
</p>

<p>
The general, having acknowledged our
salute, turned toward my uncle in such
manner as gave us to understand that he
wished to speak with him privately, and
we withdrew a short distance, to where
Gavin Witherspoon, an old acquaintance,
was making ready for the eating a string
of fish.
</p>

<p>
"Are you two lads come to see how
soldiers live?" the old man asked with
that peculiar grin which had earned for
him the name of the "big mouthed."
</p>

<p>
"If we had, it would seem that we were
come to the wrong place," Percy replied
with a laugh. "Surely you are not counting
yourself a soldier, Gavin Witherspoon?"
</p>

<p>
"I am allowin' I'll come as nigh to it as
many who wear the king's uniform. It
isn't always him who stands the stiffest
that can bring down the most game, an'
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_34' name='Page_34'>[34]</a></span>
there's no need of my tellin' two lads by
the name of Sumter that we of Williamsburg
are not given to wastin' ammunition."
</p>

<p>
"Of that I am not so certain," Percy
retorted, "for within the past three hours,
forty, who might perhaps claim this district
as their home, had fair shot at us,
and within fifty-yard range, therefore you
can see for yourself whether the ammunition
was wasted or not."
</p>

<p>
"Forty?" Gavin cried excitedly, forgetting
for the instant his camp duties at this
mention of the enemy.
</p>

<p>
I was not minded to keep the old man in
suspense, therefore at once told him of
what we had seen, whereupon he ceased his
labors as cook and began overhauling the
long, smooth-bore rifle, in the use of which
he might truly be called an expert.
</p>

<p>
"Are you going out single-handed in
search of them?" Percy asked banteringly.
</p>

<p>
"Hark you, lads! I served under General
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_35' name='Page_35'>[35]</a></span>
Marion in '75, when he was only a captain,
and know full well what manner of man
he is. Neither he nor Major James would
remain here idle after such a story as you
have brought, and I venture to say this
mess of fish won't be needed until they are
past cookin'."
</p>

<p>
Gavin Witherspoon had no more than
spoken, before we heard the word passed
from man to man around the encampment
that an immediate advance was to be
made.
</p>

<p>
Now to the credit of the men of Williamsburg,
let me set down this fact, that without
the least show of hesitation, although
it was understood the enemy which we
had reported far outnumbered us, every
member of the brigade set about his preparations
for the journey with apparently
as much pleasure as if bent on some merry-making.
</p>

<p>
We were not well supplied with provisions,
yet there were others than Gavin
Witherspoon who left the food by the fires,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_36' name='Page_36'>[36]</a></span>
lest perchance they should be among the
last who were ready.
</p>

<p>
I think no more than twenty minutes
passed from the time of our arrival until
everything was in readiness&mdash;every man
mounted, except the commanding officers,
and Percy said to me mournfully:
</p>

<p>
"It is like to benefit us but little, this
having been enlisted under General Marion,
for how may we keep pace with the horsemen?"
</p>

<p>
I had asked myself that question, and
decided that on this expedition, which
rightfully belonged to us because of the discovery,
we must perforce be left behind.
</p>

<p>
"All appear to have forgotten us; even
Gavin Witherspoon no longer looks our
way," Percy continued, and it was then
that our uncle called us by name.
</p>

<p>
It can well be imagined that we lost no
time in obeying the summons, and, approaching
to where he was standing in
company with the general and a captain, we
heard that which gave us much pleasure.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_37' name='Page_37'>[37]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"Captain Mouzon has generously offered
you lads a mount. His spare horses are
to be found back here in the thicket, under
care of the servants," my uncle said. "You
will overtake us as soon as may be, and report
at once to me. The general has been
pleased to detail you for special duty."
</p>

<p>
While speaking he mounted his horse,
the others doing the same, and as Percy
and I hurried away the word was given
for the command to advance.
</p>

<p>
Even at the expense of telling over-much
that may seem like dry reading, I must
make especial mention of the advantage we
had over the enemy, in the way of horses.
</p>

<p>
The Carolinians dearly loved a thoroughbred,
and in Williamsburg district every
soldier was mounted in kingly fashion.
</p>

<p>
The heavy, lumbering work-horses which
were sold to the redcoats, were like snails
compared with the blooded stock our people
rode, and because of these did General Marion
owe much of his success in the days to
come, when we dashed here and there over
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_38' name='Page_38'>[38]</a></span>
the country, striking a blow at night twenty
miles or more away from where we had
hurled ourselves upon the foe in the
morning.
</p>

<p>
Now we two lads knew that Captain
Mouzon had in his stables not less than
thirty beasts which had no superiors in the
neighborhood, and therefore were we positive
of being astride such as would carry
us well in the advance, however mad might
be the pace set.
</p>

<p>
We found old Jacob, the captain's chief
groom, in charge of four clean-limbed, noble
beasts as ever wore a saddle, and it was not
an easy matter to persuade him we had authority
to select such as we chose, for he
claimed that until a lad had had much experience
in the hunting field, he was not
to be trusted with a choice of mounts.
</p>

<p>
Threats would have availed us but little,
for despite the old fellow's dark skin, he
had a brave heart when the welfare of his
stable was at stake, and therefore we spoke
him fairly, using soft words rather than
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_39' name='Page_39'>[39]</a></span>
harsh, until, coming to believe we were but
repeating the words of his master, he saddled
the horses we had selected.
</p>

<p>
Bestride such animals as could not well
be excelled in the Carolinas, Percy and I
set forth in pursuit of our friends, confident
that we would be able to give a good account
of ourselves, although sadly lacking
an outfit.
</p>

<p>
"Unless it so be we can borrow powder
and ball, I fear our share in the punishment
of the Tories will be slight indeed," my
brother said mournfully, and I laughed at
his gloomy face.
</p>

<p>
"Two hours ago, when we were hastening
back from Pingree's Mill, you would
have said that with steeds like these we
should be equipped in most kingly fashion,
and now that we have under us the choice
of Captain Mouzon's stud, you find yet
further necessities."
</p>

<p>
"I leave it to you to say if five bullets
and half a horn of powder make any very
formidable outfit under such leaders as
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_40' name='Page_40'>[40]</a></span>
General Marion and our uncle, the major,
both of whom are like to show a greediness
for fighting?"
</p>

<p>
It was a matter which could not be remedied,
this lack of ammunition, until we
were come up with some acquaintance who
had a larger store than he needed, and such
an one might be difficult to find in the district
of Williamsburg, for we who held to
the Cause were poor in everything save
the desire to aid our country.
</p>

<p>
That exhilaration which comes with the
stride of a horse when one is in the saddle
was upon me, and, for the time being, I gave
little heed to our necessities, save that I
remembered with regret the fish Gavin
Witherspoon had wasted.
</p>

<p>
After a tramp of twenty miles Percy and
I stood in need of food, and but for our
own foolhardiness we might have eaten
our fill from the different messes which
the men left behind, instantly the word was
given that the enemy were in such position
as invited attack.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_41' name='Page_41'>[41]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
When we were come up with the command,
Major James beckoned for us to join
the general and himself, and then it was
we learned what work had been cut out for
us.
</p>

<p>
"It is my desire," General Marion said
as if speaking to comrades, "that you two
lads seek out the haunts of the Tories in
this vicinity, and do not let it be known
you are enlisted with us. While our numbers
are few, the blows must be quick and
frequent, therefore it is necessary we have
constantly in advance searchers, or scouts,
whichever you may choose to call them."
</p>

<p>
"Are we to bear no share in the fighting,
sir?" I ventured to ask, and a great disappointment
came into my heart that we
were to be of so little service.
</p>

<p>
"No more than absolutely necessary.
You can serve the Cause to better purpose
otherwise, for two lads like yourselves are
less liable to suspicion when venturing in
the enemy's country."
</p>

<p>
"Any who know us as members of the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_42' name='Page_42'>[42]</a></span>
James family will understand full well
that we have no sympathy with the Tories,"
Percy cried, whereat the general laughed
heartily as, turning to the major, he
said:
</p>

<p>
"The ties of kinship are drawn more
closely in the Carolinas than elsewhere in
all the world, I believe, and well it should
be so." Then he added, looking directly at
me. "We shall stir up the nest which you
two found, and perhaps give you a share
of the fighting, but only because Britton's
Neck is, from this point, on the direct road
to another quarter I would have you visit.
You may, if you please, join us in the first
attack, and then I shall expect you to ride
toward Indian Village, where I have reason
to believe certain enemies under one Captain
Barfield may be found. You will gain
so much of information as is possible, and
report to me somewhere on the east bank
of Cedar Creek."
</p>

<p>
So that we were to join in this first attack
I gave little thought for the future,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_43' name='Page_43'>[43]</a></span>
and said to myself that if we proved our
metal in one case we might find further
opportunities.
</p>

<p>
The general dismissed us with a friendly
nod, and we rode down the line, hoping to
find some friend who would loan us powder
and ball.
</p>

<p>
In this last quest we were so far successful
as to obtain, perhaps, sufficient for
five charges more, and then we had even
a larger store than many a man who rode
with the brigade.
</p>

<p>
It was within an hour of sunset when
we set out for Britton's Neck, on the first
ride Percy and I had ever undertaken for
the Cause, and it would please me much
to repeat all the incidents of that night's
journey, for they are so deeply impressed
upon my memory as never to be effaced
by whatsoever of adventure may come to
me later in life.
</p>

<p>
It is not well that I devote so much space,
however, to what others may think uninteresting,
and, therefore, acting on Percy's
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_44' name='Page_44'>[44]</a></span>
advice, I shall say no more concerning
the journey when our brigade, only four
companies strong, rode through the silent
hours of the night at a slow trot, eager to
measure strength with an enemy known
to be several times greater in numbers
than we could muster.
</p>

<p>
The gray light of the early dawn was
just becoming tinged with that yellow tint
which betokens the near approach of the
sun, when at a signal from Major James
we came to a halt.
</p>

<p>
Not until that moment could I see any
signs of the enemy, and then, gazing in
the direction indicated by General Marion's
outstretched hand, I saw dimly amid the
mist the outlines of an encampment so
large, that for the moment I had no question
but what Sam Lee told us only the
truth when he said the force of Tories to
be full two thousand.
</p>

<p>
It may have been one minute or ten that
we remained there, horses and men silent,
and motionless as statues; so great was
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_45' name='Page_45'>[45]</a></span>
my excitement that I could not count the
passage of time. Only this do I know,
that it seemed as if we wasted all that early
time of morning twilight before the signal
was given.
</p>

<p>
Then it was my uncle raised his hat,
waving it above his head at the instant he
gave rein to his horse, and so eager were
our men to be at the throats of the enemy,
that before the major's steed had fairly
made the first bound, every member of the
brigade was riding forward in mad haste.
</p>

<p>
The onward rush of that body of horsemen
must have presented a singular
spectacle, had any one been near at hand
to look at it calmly.
</p>

<p>
In the gray light four hundred or more
men riding at full speed in perfect silence,
save for the thud of the horses' feet upon
the sward, and with them in their very
midst, thanks to the fleetness of Captain
Mouzon's steeds, were Percy and I.
</p>

<p>
My one thought was that to prove myself
a worthy follower of such a commander,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_46' name='Page_46'>[46]</a></span>
I must in this attack appear the equal of
any man in the ranks, and, having such
aim in view, I urged the willing steed forward.
</p>

<p>
Percy was not minded to be left behind
when there was a chance one might be
accused of timorousness, and side by side
we rode as if on a wager, soon outstripping
all save two who were leading the
advance.
</p>

<p>
These two were the major, our uncle, and
Captain Mouzon, owner of the horses we
bestrode.
</p>

<p>
We four were well up to the edge of the
encampment by the time I understood we
were comparatively alone, and not until
then, when the first word was spoken, did
I fully realize the situation.
</p>

<p>
"The Mouzon stables lead!" the captain
cried triumphantly, thinking even at that
moment of peril more about his horses than
himself.
</p>

<p>
"But the tribe of James are riding
them!" the major shouted, and then, as if
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_47' name='Page_47'>[47]</a></span>
he had come up through the earth, a Tory
horseman appeared directly in front of us.
</p>

<p>
Two pistols were discharged almost in
our very faces&mdash;so near that the mane of
my horse was singed by the fire, and then
this particular enemy was in full retreat.
</p>

<p>
"It is Major Gainey!" our leader shouted
as he struck the spurs into his steed, and
before one had time to realize anything
more we four were in the very midst of the
Tory band, while around us, forming a
circle of fire, were the flashes of burning
powder.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_48' name='Page_48'>[48]</a></span>
</p>

<h2>
CHAPTER III.<br />
<span class="s08">THE TORY CAMP.</span></h2>

<p>
It was the first time Percy and I had
ever taken part in a deadly encounter,
and, perchance, had there been opportunity
for us to consider the situation, one
or both might have shown the white
feather.
</p>

<p>
As it was, however, and I have since
noted the fact on every similar occasion,
there was no opportunity for fear; the fever
of excitement was upon us; the odor of
burned powder mounted to one's brain, as
it were, and we became more like brutes
than human beings.
</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i060" id="i060"></a>
<img src="images/i-060.jpg" width="336" height="550" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Then suddenly a redcoated Tory rushed toward me with upraised
saber.&mdash;<a href="#Page_49">Page 49</a>.
</p>
</div>
<p>
There was to me a certain sense of satisfaction
in the danger; a savage delight in
shooting, with intent to kill, at the enemies
of our country, and above all, the knowledge
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_49' name='Page_49'>[49]</a></span>
that we were proving ourselves worthy a
place in the James family.
</p>

<p>
I saw Captain Mouzon's horse fall, and
looked with a certain curiosity to see how
he might extricate himself from the weight
of the animal.
</p>

<p>
I also wondered where Sam Lee might
be, hoping it would be my good fortune
to come upon him. Then suddenly, when
my musket was empty, a redcoated Tory
rushed toward me with upraised saber.
</p>

<p>
I tried to ward off the blow with my gun,
knowing full well that I could not hope to
be successful in such an encounter, and
then the man suddenly fell to the ground
as if stricken by a bolt of lightning.
</p>

<p>
It was Percy who had brought the Tory
down, thus saving my life, and I heard him,
as one hears from afar off, cry impatiently:
</p>

<p>
"My last charge of powder is gone!"
</p>

<p>
It is impossible for me to say, and I have
pondered over the matter again and again,
why it was that the scene suddenly
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_50' name='Page_50'>[50]</a></span>
changed, or how we three&mdash;for now that
Captain Mouzon was on foot he did not
count as one of our squad&mdash;emerged from
that tangle of men, and found ourselves
in pursuit of the fleeing, panic-stricken
enemy. I remember clearly that one
moment it was as if we were entirely surrounded,
and the next, all was clear before
us, save for that blotch of red in the
distance which we pursued at the full
speed of our horses, Major James shouting
now and again as if to give us lads
courage:
</p>

<p>
"If it so be that we ride hard they cannot
escape us! Spare not your horses, lads, and
we shall soon clear Williamsburg district
of the nest of vipers that should have been
crushed out years ago!"
</p>

<p>
I was near to smiling, despite the fact
that this was a race in which human life
had been put at stake, because our uncle
should suggest that we might take any
part in wiping out the "vipers," when our
last charge of ammunition was expended,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_51' name='Page_51'>[51]</a></span>
and we carried no other arms than
muskets.
</p>

<p>
Yet did we press on at his heels with all
the speed of which Captain Mouzon's steeds
were capable, eager to gain the advance
if that might be, lest he should for a
single instant fancy we had grown faint-hearted.
</p>

<p>
It was the first time we had had an opportunity
of proving that the James blood
ran in our veins, and had I been certain
death awaited me at the end of that mad
chase, I would have spurred my horse on
yet faster, exulting in the thought that I
might come to my end in such noble
fashion as now, when following the lead of
Major James!
</p>

<p>
Percy shouted like one who is without
sense, and yet there was no thought in my
mind of chiding him, for I understood full
well why it was that the sound of his own
voice seemed necessary&mdash;it was but the
natural vent of the excitement that had
taken hold of him like as a fever, and I
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_52' name='Page_52'>[52]</a></span>
have since been told that I also cried out
unmeaning words; but yet was unconscious
of having done so.
</p>

<p>
Then suddenly the scene changed again,
and with this transformation came into
my heart what was very like fear.
</p>

<p>
One moment it was as if we had the
whole of General Marion's force at our
heels, and the next we were alone, riding
down into that mass of fleeing Tories
who outnumbered us two hundred to one,
while not a friend of the Cause could be
seen in the rear.
</p>

<p>
I saw Major James glancing over his
shoulder, and involuntarily I copied the
movement, although for thirty seconds or
more had I known we were so far in the
advance as to be practically cut off from
our friends.
</p>

<p>
There was no change of expression in my
uncle's face when he realized that we were
come into sore danger&mdash;for now we were
well upon the heels of the enemy;&mdash;but he
looked at me as if asking whether the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_53' name='Page_53'>[53]</a></span>
knowledge of our situation brought timorousness
into my heart.
</p>

<p>
I have ever been proud because at that
instant I answered his inquiring look with
such words as tickled his fancy mightily:
</p>

<p>
"There be three of us, Major, and more
are not needed."
</p>

<p>
It was the speech of a braggart, but yet
under such circumstances the words gave
my uncle more confidence in our courage
than almost anything else could have
done, and an expression, which for the
moment I took to be affection, came
over his face as he replied in a ringing
tone:
</p>

<p>
"God bless the sister who gave to me such
nephews!" Then, waving his saber and
shouting at the full strength of his lungs as
if he had a thousand men behind him, he
cried, "Here they are, boys! Here they
are! Come on!"
</p>

<p>
I believe of a verity that the Tories
fancied he was calling to a large force,
rather than to two lads who were practically
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_54' name='Page_54'>[54]</a></span>
weaponless, for their panic increased,
if that could be possible, and they crowded
upon each other's heels until the advance
was impeded.
</p>

<p>
With fifty well-armed men at that time
I venture to say we might have wiped out
Major Gainey's entire force, and that officer
himself was nigh to being taken prisoner
when my uncle, spurring his horse into the
very midst of the fugitives, singled out the
leader as if challenging him to mortal
combat.
</p>

<p>
Major Gainey, although he was a Tory,
had never been called a coward; but on
this morning he absolutely refused the
challenge, and instead of halting to meet
the foe as he would have done had his cause
been just, he forced aside the weaker of his
following, and succeeded in making good
an escape.
</p>

<p>
"It was shame enough that one from
Williamsburg should be a Tory," my uncle
cried, brandishing his saber in impotent
rage; "but that a Gainey would show himself
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_55' name='Page_55'>[55]</a></span>
a coward as well, I have never believed
until this hour."
</p>

<p>
It was strange indeed that of all the
enemy we pursued so hotly and so closely,
none turned upon us.
</p>

<p>
It would have been a simple task for a
dozen of them, armed as we knew they
were, to have allowed us to come into their
midst, and then, closing, taken all three
prisoners, or shot us down as might best
have suited their fancy.
</p>

<p>
The fever of fear, however, was upon
them until there was no thought in the
minds of any save of individual safety, and
during ten minutes or more we rode upon
the heels of that retreating rabble, taunting
them with such words as should have
turned the faintest-hearted at bay.
</p>

<p>
There were seconds during that chase
when I trembled with what was like unto
a fear, realizing all which it was possible
for them to do, and then that sensation
would pass away while rage took possession
of me because of my inability to do
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_56' name='Page_56'>[56]</a></span>
other than lash the miserable Tories with
my tongue.
</p>

<p>
Then Major James wheeled suddenly
about, for we had come to the edge of Pedee
Swamp, and, by his gesture rather than
words, we understood that it was our turn
to retreat.
</p>

<p>
The Tories were forced, because of the
water, to ride more slowly, and should we
still press upon them they must, even like
rats, turn at bay; when, as a matter of
course, the end would have come for us.
</p>

<p>
We had shown them what a man could
do whose cause was just, and it would have
been folly to continue on to the useless
sacrifice of our own lives.
</p>

<p>
We turned about, as I have said, in
obedience to my uncle's signal, and rode to
the rear faster than we came, for now was
there fear some of the cowardly foe might
shoot us in the back, and before drawing
rein we came upon General Marion and
Captain M'Cottry.
</p>

<p>
These two were, like ourselves, far in
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_57' name='Page_57'>[57]</a></span>
advance, and by reining in his horse the
general forced us to halt.
</p>

<p>
Now occurred that which I shall ever
remember with the most intense pride and
satisfaction so long as the breath remains
in my body.
</p>

<p>
He who was to be afterward so well-known
as the "Swamp Fox," he who was
the bravest among all the brave men in the
Carolinas, leaning forward in the saddle
held out his hands, one to each of us lads,
and said in a tone so hearty that there could
be no mistaking the sentiment in his heart:
</p>

<p>
"I have ever believed the members of
the James family to be true to their
country, their friends, and to themselves;
but never before had I expected to see two
boys ride at their kinsman's call straight
into what seemed certain danger. I am
proud indeed that you were eager to seek
service under my command, and promise
that if my life be spared you shall have
fitting opportunity to show your devotion
to the Cause."
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_58' name='Page_58'>[58]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
We lads were unable to speak because
of the pride and pleasure which filled our
hearts to overflowing; but my uncle,
taking off his hat with more of homage
than I had ever seen him bestow upon any
other man, made reply:
</p>

<p>
"When General Marion is pleased to
speak such words to members of my
family, he places under obligation every
one of us."
</p>

<p>
"There can be no sense of obligation,
Major, when the praise has been won so
handsomely."
</p>

<p>
"In that I agree with you, General, and
more particularly because neither of my
nephews had a charge of ammunition.
After the first rush they followed bravely,
although virtually weaponless, and I am
happy to be able to call them my sister's
sons. The ride is completed, and we now
await your orders."
</p>

<p>
"Have all the force escaped?" the general
asked.
</p>

<p>
"Ay, sir, all save those who may have
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_59' name='Page_59'>[59]</a></span>
been rendered unable to continue the
retreat. They are in Pedee Swamp where
it would be worse than folly to make any
attempt at following them."
</p>

<p>
The general wheeled his horse around,
motioning Percy and I to ride by his side,
and together we returned to where the
main body of our brigade was halted.
</p>

<p>
Here after a short time we learned that
a captain and nine men had been killed
from among the Tory force, while our loss
amounted to only two wounded, and it
was safe to say that many days would
elapse before Major Gainey's regiment
could be got into fighting shape again.
</p>

<p>
There was no reason why any of us
should longer suffer from hunger, for we
were in possession of the Tory camp where
were provisions in abundance, and during
an hour we feasted, Percy and I, as only
lads can who have been without food nigh
on to four and twenty hours.
</p>

<p>
Then, when believing it would be possible
to return to our home for a short time&mdash;and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_60' name='Page_60'>[60]</a></span>
we were eager to tell our mother of
the proud distinction we had won&mdash;word
was brought by one of the troopers that
General Marion would speak with us.
</p>

<p>
I venture to say there was not a man in
the brigade who did not envy us two lads
as we went toward that portion of the
thicket where the commander was seated
under a live oak tree with his officers
clustered about him, and I am also quite
certain that of all the force, we two had
the least right to be praised or singled out
for preferment.
</p>

<p>
Among those who served the Cause in
the Carolinas there were no cowards; it
appeared much as if the timorous ones
turned Tories because, by professing to
serve the king, a colonist is not required
to bear so many hardships or encounter so
many dangers, as those who would throw
off his majesty's yoke. Therefore it was
that when an officer like General Marion
selected two from among all that gathering,
it was indeed a great distinction, and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_61' name='Page_61'>[61]</a></span>
we understood by his sending for us that
we were like to be called upon for an especial
service, as he had already intimated.
</p>

<p>
Although unused to such a life as we
had so suddenly embarked upon, Percy
and I contrived to salute the general in
something approaching military fashion,
and he, returning it, asked in the tone of a
friend rather than of one who commands:
</p>

<p>
"Are you lads minded to set out on a
venture which has in it much of danger?"
</p>

<p>
Percy looked at me as if to say that I
should act as spokesman, and I replied
more readily than perhaps was courteous,
fearing lest it might be fancied we
hesitated:
</p>

<p>
"Aye, sir; that we are, and the more of
danger the more readily do we set out. I
say this last not in a boasting manner,
but to show you, sir, that we are right
willing to lay down our lives for the good
of the Cause which our uncle serves."
</p>

<p>
"It is well spoken, young sir. I had
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_62' name='Page_62'>[62]</a></span>
no doubt of your willingness; but rather
made mention of the danger that you
might have an opportunity to draw back
honorably, if it so be you shrank in any
degree from the task, for it is one through
which little honor can be gained, although
the service must be performed."
</p>

<p>
"We are ready for whatsoever pleases
you, sir," I said, and Percy laid his hand
in mine that it might be understood he repeated
the words.
</p>

<p>
"Between here and Dubose Ferry&mdash;the
precise location you must yourselves determine&mdash;one
Captain Barfield lies encamped,
having under him a force not
less than four hundred strong. Our purpose
is to advance upon him immediately;
but having learned that there is a possibility
his men may far exceed ours in numbers,
it is necessary we have full information
before venturing an attack. Are you
minded to seek him out, and learn all that
may be ascertained within a few hours,
returning to us before nightfall?"
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_63' name='Page_63'>[63]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"We will set out at once, sir. Captain
Mouzon lent us horses that we might join
in the march, and perhaps he will allow
us to use them in this service," I said, turning
toward the captain, who replied
readily:
</p>

<p>
"That you may, lads, and in welcome.
I am right glad that the Mouzon stables
can furnish mounts for such riders as you
have shown yourselves to be."
</p>

<p>
"Then we will set out at once, sir," I
said to the general. "The horses have already
been cared for, and should be able
to make the journey without distress."
</p>

<p>
"There is no time to be lost. You yourselves
are to decide how the information
we desire can best and most safely be obtained,
for it would be unwise to hamper
you with advice or commands. At about
noon the brigade will set out at a slow
pace in the direction of Dubose Ferry, and
I hope you may be able to meet us several
miles this side of the encampment.
We shall ride so nearly as may be in a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_64' name='Page_64'>[64]</a></span>
straight line, and at about nightfall keep
sharp watch for your approach. The most
important information is as to the number
of the enemy; then the general position
of the camp, and, finally, how it may be
best come upon."
</p>

<p>
Having said this the general saluted,
as did the officers round about him, and
Percy and I, understanding that we were
dismissed, would have moved away, but
that the major, my uncle, stepped forward,
taking us each by the hand.
</p>

<p>
He spoke no word; but I understood
that he was bidding us good-by, and his
manner of doing it told me, had such information
been necessary, how dangerous
was the mission with which we were
charged.
</p>

<p>
Again the general and his officers saluted,
and then we, turning on our heels, set
about making ready for the departure.
</p>

<p>
Some of the men lounging nearabout
would have spoken with us; but I was not
minded to indulge in conversation just at
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_65' name='Page_65'>[65]</a></span>
that moment, and it seemed much as if
Percy had the same idea.
</p>

<p>
Beginning to realize more fully each
moment what this duty on which we were
embarked might mean, I feared lest we
grow faint-hearted because of the perils.
To have spoken with any one regarding
the service, would have been to show us
more plainly all that it meant, and silence
was safest if we would hold our uncle's
good opinion.
</p>

<p>
The horses were saddled, and we about
to mount when Gavin Witherspoon, whom
I had not seen since the attack, came up
hurriedly and with the air of one who is
in a fault-finding mood.
</p>

<p>
"So! We are much puffed up with
pride, eh, since it has been our good fortune
to follow Major James in pursuit of a lot
of scurvy Tories? We don't care to speak
with old friends?"
</p>

<p>
"Now you are disgruntled without cause,
Gavin Witherspoon," Percy said laughingly.
"How may it be possible that we
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_66' name='Page_66'>[66]</a></span>
speak with old or new friends when we
fail to meet them. Since you dropped the
fish so hurriedly, we have not had a glimpse
of your face, and I question if you cared to
meet us until, perhaps, within an hour."
</p>

<p>
"I have been looking for you high and
low since we came to a halt here."
</p>

<p>
"Then it must be your eyes are grown
dim with age," I said, now joining my
brother in his mirth, for the old man's
anger was comical rather than serious.
"We unsaddled our horses in this spot,
and have remained until within ten
minutes under this same tree, therefore it
could not have been a difficult matter to
find us."
</p>

<p>
"But there is no reason for fault-finding,
and we have little time to spend in conversation,"
Percy added.
</p>

<p>
"You will speak with me though!"
Gavin said, seizing the bridle of my horse
as if fearing I was about to ride away.
"In what direction are you two lads
going?"
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_67' name='Page_67'>[67]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"That we may not say," Percy replied
quickly. "It is enough that we are acting
upon General Marion's orders."
</p>

<p>
"That is as I suspected," Gavin cried,
shaking his fist at Percy as if the lad had
proven himself guilty of some serious
crime. "You would slip away from the
old man, believing yourselves so wondrous
brave that he isn't fit to join in any adventure
however trifling?"
</p>

<p>
"Now you are talking wildly, Gavin
Witherspoon," I said, losing my patience,
for, knowing we had but little time at our
disposal, I was fretted by what seemed to
me no more than folly. "We have been
entrusted with a duty which must be performed
immediately, and may not stand
here parleying with you over trifling
matters."
</p>

<p>
"It is my intention you shall remain
until I can have speech with General
Marion, or failing him, with Major James."
</p>

<p>
"Why should we wait for that?" Percy
asked, leaping into the saddle, and as he
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_68' name='Page_68'>[68]</a></span>
did so the old man seized the bridle of his
horse also.
</p>

<p>
"Because I am counting on going with
you. I promised your mother six months
or more ago that when you two lads were
minded to turn soldiers I would keep an
eye upon you, and now has come the time
when I must fulfil the pledge, or write
myself down a liar."
</p>

<p>
I knew enough of the old man's character
to understand that we could not
browbeat him into loosing his hold of the
bridle, and was not minded to ride over
him. Therefore said with as much of
patience as I could assume:
</p>

<p>
"So that you move quickly, we will
wait until you can speak with either officer
you name; but remember, Gavin, we
are under orders to set off without delay."
</p>

<p>
"What have you in the way of
weapons?"
</p>

<p>
Until this moment, strange as it may
seem, I had entirely lost sight of the fact
that we were virtually unarmed, and now
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_69' name='Page_69'>[69]</a></span>
I realized the folly of setting out so wholly
unprepared.
</p>

<p>
"We must have ammunition if nothing
more," I said hurriedly, "and while you
are gone in search of the general, I will
set about procuring it. Therefore the
time spent in waiting for you will not be
wasted."
</p>

<p>
Gavin Witherspoon now seemed to have
every confidence that we would not slip
away from him, and hurried off toward
the other end of the encampment, while
I went from one acquaintance to another
in search of powder and ball.
</p>

<p>
In this quest I was more successful
than had seemed possible.
</p>

<p>
Knowing that we lads had been entrusted
with a mission, the men bestirred
themselves to see that we were outfitted
properly, and soon our store of ammunition
was even greater than could be used
to advantage.
</p>

<p>
We had two horns full of powder, thirty
or forty balls, and a couple of pistols;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_70' name='Page_70'>[70]</a></span>
more than that would have hampered our
movements.
</p>

<p>
Perhaps no more than ten minutes had
been spent in outfitting ourselves, and yet
this time was sufficient for Gavin to make
his preparations to accompany us, as was
shown when he rode up while I was dividing
the ammunition with Percy.
</p>

<p>
"Is it really your purpose to follow us?"
I asked in surprise, for it had not seemed
to me probable the old man would be allowed
to join in the venture.
</p>

<p>
"I am not countin' to <i>follow</i>, lads; but
ride side by side with you, and perhaps
somewhat in advance. I'm not thinkin' of
letting you go on this mission alone&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"It may be safer for two than for three,"
Percy said half to himself, and the old man,
without so much as turning his head, replied
solemnly and in such a tone as impressed
me strangely:
</p>

<p>
"There is nothing whatsoever of safety
in an attempt to ride from here to Dubose
Ferry, for two, or even a dozen of those
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_71' name='Page_71'>[71]</a></span>
who love the cause. My going with you
will neither increase nor lessen the danger,
because that is impossible. It may be,
however, that I can give a word of advice
which will prevent your coming to a final
end quite so soon, for I hold to it that General
Marion and Major James have this
day sent you lads to what is little less than
death."
</p>

<p>
Having thus spoken, and in a manner
well calculated to disturb even the stoutest
hearted lad, the old man wheeled his horse
about and rode in the direction of Dubose
Ferry, never so much as turning his head
to see if we were following him.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_72' name='Page_72'>[72]</a></span>
</p>

<h2>
CHAPTER IV.<br />
<span class="s08">SAMUEL LEE.</span></h2>

<p>
Had Gavin Witherspoon been less strange
in his manner, I should have taken little
heed of his joining us in the mission with
which we had been entrusted by General
Marion, because the old man was often
given to whims, and this could well
have been considered as simply a fancy
on his part to indulge in the love for adventure.
</p>

<p>
If he had contented himself with vague
words concerning the possible danger,
neither Percy nor I would have paid any
particular attention to him, believing he
simply magnified the peril in order that it
might appear as if he counted on being able
to protect us.
</p>

<p>
His manner, however, was so exceeding
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_73' name='Page_73'>[73]</a></span>
odd&mdash;I can find no word which comes nearer
explaining it&mdash;that I believed at once he
was in possession of some knowledge which
we did not share, and therefore had good
reason for crediting all he said.
</p>

<p>
A year later, perhaps, after I had had more
experience in what some gentlemen are
pleased to call the "art of warfare," I might
have held my peace, trusting in our ability
to ward off such dangers as should arise,
but then, ignorant as we were of a soldier's
life, the old man's actions impressed me
disagreeably, as I have said already, and I
was minded to demand from him an
explanation.
</p>

<p>
Never before had I found it a difficult
matter to gain speech with Gavin Witherspoon,
for the old man was prone to indulge
in conversation regardless of suitable opportunity
or place; but on this morning
Percy and I found it necessary to ride at
full speed in order to come alongside our
self-appointed guardian, and we were, perhaps,
five miles from the camp when I
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_74' name='Page_74'>[74]</a></span>
finally succeeded in forcing him to open
his mouth.
</p>

<p>
"If you count to ride with us, Master
Witherspoon, and claim that it is your
purpose to protect Percy and I, we at least
have the right to know why such an escort
is considered necessary."
</p>

<p>
"That I have already explained," the old
man replied curtly, and would have spurred
ahead of us once more but that Percy
caught his bridle rein, as he said sharply:
</p>

<p>
"We are minded, Gavin Witherspoon, to
know the meaning of your mysterious
words and odd behavior. If it so be you
know more concerning the enemy than is
told among the men of our brigade, let us
hear it now, that my brother and I may
be in some degree prepared for coming
events."
</p>

<p>
"I have ridden with the command, and
had no more means of gaining information
than others. What may be in my mind
has come there through what I call sound
commonsense."
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_75' name='Page_75'>[75]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"And you have reasoned out that we are
in greater danger than we were four and
twenty hours ago?" I said with a laugh,
beginning to feel somewhat of relief in my
mind by this discovery, as I believed, that
the old man's fears were the result of his
own imagination.
</p>

<p>
He must have read in the tone of my
voice somewhat of that in my mind, for,
reining in his horse, he wheeled around to
face Percy and myself as he replied, speaking
slowly and with exceeding earnestness:
</p>

<p>
"It was known to the leaders of our
brigade that Captain Barfield had a force
of Tories nearabout Dubose Ferry. Think
you Major Gainey and his men did not
have the same information?"
</p>

<p>
"Of course they did," I replied, wondering
greatly what the old man would
come at.
</p>

<p>
"It is no more of a journey from Pedee
Swamp to Dubose Ferry, than from where
we halted for breakfast."
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_76' name='Page_76'>[76]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Again he paused as if waiting some
reply; but neither Percy nor I spoke, for
as yet we failed to understand what he was
trying to convey.
</p>

<p>
"Major Gainey's force has lost an outfit,
since our people took possession of it, and
must, therefore, seek another encampment.
Do you believe they will be content to
remain in the swamp, knowin' their friends
are near at hand?"
</p>

<p>
"It would be reasonable that they rode
in the direction of the Ferry," Percy said,
an expression of deepest seriousness chasing
away the smile which had been upon
his lips.
</p>

<p>
"Very well. Since you allow that, there
is no need for me to say more. It is the
general belief that Gainey had near to two
thousand men with him, an' think you they
will not fight, however much cowardice
may be in their hearts, when next we ride
upon them? If these two forces of Tories
come together&mdash;and by this time I venture
to say the men we routed in the early dawn
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_77' name='Page_77'>[77]</a></span>
have begun to understand how few we
are in numbers&mdash;I look to see hot work.
Therefore it is I predict that before arrivin'
at Dubose Ferry we shall meet with many
of those who so lately fled before us."
</p>

<p>
I now realized why the old man looked
upon the situation as being grave in the
extreme, and there was no further inclination
in my mind to make sport of his forebodings.
</p>

<p>
Having learned what it might, perhaps,
have been better we did not know, Percy
and I became quite as solemn as was
Gavin Witherspoon, and we three rode on
again as if certain some evil fortune was
about to overtake us, neither so much as
speaking until half an hour or more had
passed, when we came to a sudden halt.
</p>

<p>
Our road at this time lay through the
bottom-lands, which were covered with a
growth of scrub oaks, and we had heard a
noise as of horsemen forcing their way
through the foliage.
</p>

<p>
This it was which had caused us to halt so
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_78' name='Page_78'>[78]</a></span>
suddenly, and I was looking to my rifle to
make certain it was loaded, when Sam Lee
came into view.
</p>

<p>
He was riding a heavily-built iron-gray
horse, the very animal I could have sworn
to seeing during the brush with Major
Gainey's force. Upon his face was an expression
of deepest satisfaction and joy,
which did not change materially when he
saw us.
</p>

<p>
Percy, quicker than I at such times, cried
out for the Tory to halt, and he wisely
obeyed the command, knowing full well
his steed would have no show in a race
with such animals as we bestrode, even
though our rifles might not have brought
him to a halt.
</p>

<p>
"Well," he asked, with an evil look upon
his face. "Since when have you begun to
stop peaceful travelers?"
</p>

<p>
"We have not yet commenced," I cried,
allowing anger to take possession of me.
"In these times a Tory cannot lay claim
to peacefulness, and it is our purpose to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_79' name='Page_79'>[79]</a></span>
make such prisoners whenever and wherever
we find them."
</p>

<p>
"And I am a prisoner, eh?" he asked,
with not the slightest show of fear, and I
was surprised thereat, because we knew
him to be a rank coward.
</p>

<p>
"Throw down your musket an' hold up
your hands while Percy makes search for
pistols!" Gavin Witherspoon said sternly,
for the old man was a ready comrade in
times when quick action became necessary.
</p>

<p>
Sam Lee obeyed without a word, and
after a brief search we discovered that he
had no other weapons than the musket
which lay upon the ground.
</p>

<p>
Still he appeared well satisfied&mdash;even
pleased.
</p>

<p>
It angered me yet further, this show of
carelessness, and I cried hastily:
</p>

<p>
"You were in no such happy mood this
morning, when we chased your friends into
the swamp&mdash;when less than four hundred
men put to flight two thousand!"
</p>

<p>
Gavin Witherspoon turned upon me
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_80' name='Page_80'>[80]</a></span>
quickly, and with such a show of temper
as caused me to understand in an instant
that I had thus given to the enemy information
concerning the size of General
Marion's force.
</p>

<p>
It was too late to recall the words, unfortunately,
and Sam, giving no heed to
the old man's show of resentment at my
folly, replied to the words which I had believed
would humiliate him:
</p>

<p>
"The condition of affairs in the Carolinas
have changed wonderfully within the
past few days, and we who are loyal inhabitants
of the colony have little to fear
from rebels."
</p>

<p>
Now did I realize that this Tory lad was
certain of his ground, else he would not
have dared to speak in such strain, and the
result was that I, rather than our prisoner,
grew disheartened.
</p>

<p>
Gavin Witherspoon also pricked up his
ears at this bold speech from the lad who
had heretofore been so cowardly as never
to venture an opinion lest he make trouble
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_81' name='Page_81'>[81]</a></span>
for himself, and the old man asked as he
advanced toward the rascal threateningly:
</p>

<p>
"What is it that has given you such a
dose of courage, you Tory cur?"
</p>

<p>
Sam winced, as if believing Gavin Witherspoon
was about to strike him, and then,
understanding an instant later that we
were not of his kidney, who would ill-treat
a prisoner, replied with a laugh which
aroused all my anger again:
</p>

<p>
"Your General Gates with his rag-tag
and bob-tail of an army has been cut to
pieces at Camden by Lord Cornwallis!
What you are pleased to call the 'Cause,'
is now wiped out from the Carolinas!"
</p>

<p>
We three sat speechless with dismay,
gazing at each other questioningly, apprehensively,
as the young Tory told a story
which we at the time believed to be true,
and afterward came to learn that no part
had been exaggerated.
</p>

<p>
General Gates, who believed himself to
be more of a soldier than was the fact,
had moved from Rugely's Mills on the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_82' name='Page_82'>[82]</a></span>
evening of the 15th, with his entire force,
never so much as sending scouts in advance
to learn whether the enemy might be in the
vicinity. His raw recruits were suddenly
met by a volley from the British skirmishers,
and, retreating so far as seemed
necessary for safety, lay upon their arms
until morning.
</p>

<p>
When the sun rose any other general
than Gates would have known he was defeated,
even before trying the issue. His
men, unused to service, were formed in the
swamp with the reserve only a few hundred
yards in the rear of the battle line.
Perhaps not one out of ten of these had
ever been under fire, and opposed to them
were picked soldiers&mdash;the best to be found
in the king's regiments stationed at Charleston
and Camden.
</p>

<p>
At sunrise General Gates ordered the
advance of the Virginia militia, who were
met by the redcoats with such a deadly
volley that the division retreated before
more than half of them had discharged
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_83' name='Page_83'>[83]</a></span>
their muskets. The North Carolina militia
followed the disgraceful example, as did
also the cavalry, and a charge by the
British horse completed the rout.
</p>

<p>
Only the Continentals under command
of De Kalb held their ground until further
resistance would have been madness, and
the battle of Camden had been half fought,
and wholly lost.
</p>

<p>
No wonder Sam Lee was triumphant.
</p>

<p>
To us who heard the story it seemed as
if his boast that the Cause had been killed
in the Carolinas was neither more nor less
than the truth, and for a moment I fancied
it our duty to return without loss of time
to warn General Marion.
</p>

<p>
Now it may seem strange to whosoever
shall read these lines, that we believed so
readily all the Tory told us; but we had
good cause for credulity.
</p>

<p>
Old soldiers among us&mdash;and the men of
my mother's family had been in arms from
the time the colonists first began resistance
against the king's oppression&mdash;had again
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_84' name='Page_84'>[84]</a></span>
and again argued that General Gates was
not a skilful officer, despite his victory at
Saratoga.
</p>

<p>
When it was known that General Marion,
who up to the time of taking command in
the Williamsburg district had been only a
colonel, was to leave the staff of Gates, our
people predicted a disaster similar to what
it seemed had just occurred.
</p>

<p>
Therefore, when Sam Lee, liar and
coward though he was naturally, gave us
an account of the battle with so much of
detail he could not have invented, we, unfortunately,
had no choice but to believe
the tale.
</p>

<p>
It was Gavin Witherspoon who first regained
sufficient composure to understand
what should be done, and he soon showed
the Tory that, however hardly our people
had been used, it would not avail him
under the present circumstances.
</p>

<p>
"It seems to me necessary we keep this
young cub with us, however disagreeable
the association may be, and do you lads
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_85' name='Page_85'>[85]</a></span>
lash him on the saddle in such fashion
that he will not be able to make his escape
without assistance."
</p>

<p>
Although believing for the moment that
we ought to return immediately to General
Marion, I obeyed the old man's order,
and now it was that the look of satisfaction
and exultation began to vanish from
the coward's face.
</p>

<p>
He had counted on our so far losing
heart as to make an attempt at currying
favor with him, or, at least, pass him by,
and our thus guarding against the possibility
of escape was by no means to his
liking.
</p>

<p>
"What is to be done?" I asked when the
lad was secure, for I now realized, as did
Percy, that Gavin Witherspoon should be
given the command of our squad.
</p>

<p>
"We shall push on as was at first intended,
keeping our wits well about us,
lest we be surprised by others of this
fellow's kidney, who are making haste to
join Barfield. After having accomplished
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_86' name='Page_86'>[86]</a></span>
that for which we were sent, if it be possible,
there will be time enough to repeat the
disagreeable story."
</p>

<p>
I am making an overly long story of
what should be told in fewer words,
prompted to do so because of the fear
which beset me at this time and caused
the matter to seem of more importance
than it really was.
</p>

<p>
We pressed forward two hours or more,
Percy and I riding either side of the prisoner,
and Gavin Witherspoon keeping in
advance.
</p>

<p>
Then we were come, as nearly as could
be judged, to the vicinity of the Tory
camp, and might no longer with safety
use the horses.
</p>

<p>
Still acting under Gavin Witherspoon's
command, we picketed our steeds in the
thicket, leaving them and the prisoner to
the charge of Percy, while the old man
and I pressed forward to reconnoiter.
</p>

<p>
This work occupied a full hour, and
the time was by no means wasted, because
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_87' name='Page_87'>[87]</a></span>
when it had expired we were well
informed as to the number of Barfield's
men.
</p>

<p>
To the best of our belief there were not
less than eight hundred Tories fairly well
entrenched at Dubose Ferry, and Gavin
said to me as we turned to retrace our steps:
</p>

<p>
"There will be no fighting this night, unless
we are driven to it, for neither General
Marion nor Major James, however brave
they may be, will make the attack with
such odds against us, particularly while it
is certain this same force of Tories will be
reinforced before nightfall by those whom
we drove into the swamp."
</p>

<p>
A similar thought was in my own mind,
and therefore I made no reply.
</p>

<p>
It was necessary we rejoin our friends
before they should have come so far as to
put themselves in a dangerous position,
and Gavin and I hurried back to where
we had left Percy.
</p>

<p>
We had no difficulty in finding the place
where we tethered the horses, and once
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_88' name='Page_88'>[88]</a></span>
there the cold sweat of fear broke out upon
my forehead.
</p>

<p>
Percy, and prisoner, and the three horses
which we had ridden, were not to be seen.
But for the fact that the gray steed of Sam
Lee was feeding close by, I would have
said we had mistaken the location.
</p>

<p>
Words are not sufficient to describe my
condition of mind when this horrible
truth burst upon me. I could not so much
as speak; but looked questioningly at the
old man, who said slowly and in a half
whisper, after gazing carefully around:
</p>

<p>
"The boy has been captured by some of
Gainey's cowards who no doubt are hunting
for us at this moment. Sam Lee knew
for what purpose we went ahead, and as a
matter of course has given his Tory friends
all possible information."
</p>

<p>
"Why do we stand here idly?" I cried,
regaining speech when the horrible fact
had been put before me in words. "We
cannot desert him, and at whatsoever cost
must go in pursuit."
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_89' name='Page_89'>[89]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"It is not possible we could compass
anything save our own capture," Gavin
Witherspoon said, speaking slowly, and
gripping hard both my hands as if to give
me comfort.
</p>

<p>
"Surely you will not turn your back
upon him," I cried in a fury, trying to
wrench myself from his grasp; "if that
cowardly thought be in your mind you
shall go alone, for I had rather face all
Barfield's force single-handed, than have
it said I deserted my brother."
</p>

<p>
"Fair and softly, Robert Sumter, fair
and softly. I am not minded to go back.
It is you who shall do that."
</p>

<p>
"But I will not," and again I strove to
release my hands.
</p>

<p>
"Listen to me, lad, and the sooner the
better for your brother's sake, because I
shall hold you here by force until having
laid the case squarely before you. Would
you have it told that one of the James
family, on account of his own personal
grief, allowed four hundred brave men to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_90' name='Page_90'>[90]</a></span>
ride on to destruction? Would you have
it said that rather than desert your brother
you allowed the men of Williamsburg to
face certain capture or death? Yet that
is what must happen unless you are willing
to do as I bid."
</p>

<p>
"But let me hear what is in your mind,
for until then how can I answer the questions
you ask!" and now I was grown
more tractable, understanding that the old
man knew better than I what was necessary
both for the safety of Percy, and those who
were riding behind us.
</p>

<p>
"There is but one horse here, and it would
be unsafe to set out on foot. Having had
many more years of experience than you,
I should be more capable of following the
Tories who have Percy in their keeping, and
having come upon them, if there be a
chance for his rescue, ought to be able to
take better advantage of the opportunity
than you. Now this is my plan: Mount
the gray horse and ride back until you have
met our friends; tell them what has occurred,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_91' name='Page_91'>[91]</a></span>
and perchance Major James will
send forward ten or twelve experienced
woodsmen, who will help me in what seems
little better than a forlorn hope. At all
events, the gentlemen whom we both can
trust implicitly will know the situation,
and advise what we may do with honor.
In addition to that you will be spared the
pain of confessing in later days that you
did what a James should never do&mdash;left
your friends to ride blindly into such danger
as has never before come upon men of the
Carolinas."
</p>

<p>
It was not easy to follow this advice, as
may well be imagined, and I spent fully
five minutes trying to force myself to
do it.
</p>

<p>
It seemed as if by going back when Percy
had been forced to go forward, I was deserting
him, and yet such seeming desertion
was necessary to save, perhaps, the entire
Williamsburg district.
</p>

<p>
"You will return as a brave lad should,"
the old man said finally, and, my heart
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_92' name='Page_92'>[92]</a></span>
well-nigh bursting with grief, I made reply
by mounting the gray horse.
</p>

<p>
Not until then did I realize how much
Gavin Witherspoon had taken upon himself.
</p>

<p>
The old man was voluntarily remaining
behind on foot, surrounded by enemies, in
the vain hope that he might by some fortunate
accident rescue Percy, and I knew
full well that the chances were as one in a
thousand that it could not be done.
</p>

<p>
In other words, he was doing little less
than delivering himself into the hands of
the enemy and I&mdash;I was deserting him as
well as my brother.
</p>

<p>
"I can't do it, Gavin," I said, making as
if to dismount. "It is better you ride
back."
</p>

<p>
"No, lad. Having once come to a brave
decision, hold steadfast, and forget all else
save that the Cause demands the sacrifice,
perchance of your life, and certainly of
your feelings. Push the horse at his best
pace, which will be a sorry one at the most,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_93' name='Page_93'>[93]</a></span>
and before many hours have passed we
may grasp hands again; but I solemnly
swear not to desert Percy whatever may
come upon me."
</p>

<p>
I clasped the old man's hand, understanding
for the first time in my life what a
friend he was. Then, not daring to so
much as speak, I set the spurs deep into
the gray, and he bounded forward with
more of life than I had expected it would
be possible for him to show.
</p>

<p>
The wonder of it all to me is now, while
I am writing it down after so many months
have passed, that I was not captured before
having traversed a mile on the backward
journey, for I saw nothing, heeded nothing,
thought of nothing save Percy and the
brave old man who was following on his
trail.
</p>

<p>
Heedless alike of friend or foe I rode as
if in all the district of Williamsburg there
was not an enemy, and the good God
allowed me to pass through that Tory infested
district in safety.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_94' name='Page_94'>[94]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
It was no more than two hours past
noon when I came upon the advance guard
of our brigade, and five minutes later stood
before my uncle and General Marion,
shaking like one in an ague fit.
</p>

<p>
Those brave soldiers needed not to be
told that some disaster had befallen us.
The fact, although not the story, was imprinted
plainly on my face, and Major
James dismounted that he might fling his
arm around my shoulders, as he asked
softly and tenderly:
</p>

<p>
"How far beyond here did you leave
Percy and Gavin Witherspoon?"
</p>

<p>
"Within three miles of Dubose Ferry,
so nearly as I can say."
</p>

<p>
"Were you come upon Barfield's force
before this thing happened?"
</p>

<p>
Then it was that I found my tongue,
and told him all the sad story, taking good
care however, that both he and the general
understood full well the strength of the
enemy as we had found them.
</p>

<p>
"We will fall upon them as soon as may
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_95' name='Page_95'>[95]</a></span>
be," the general cried, and beckoning to
Captain Mouzon he would have given some
order but that I said hurriedly, forgetting
my manners, as well I might, after all that
had happened:
</p>

<p>
"Gavin Witherspoon declared that Major
Gainey's men would join Barfield's force,
and should the Williamsburg brigade advance,
it would be only to their capture or
death."
</p>

<p>
"Death is what every soldier must expect,
and peradventure it be delayed until
the end comes peacefully, then is he less
fortunate, perhaps, than his fellow. We
will ride on, gentlemen, and attack Barfield
as soon as we can come upon him."
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_96' name='Page_96'>[96]</a></span>
</p>

<h2>
CHAPTER V.<br />
<span class="s08">THE AMBUSH.</span></h2>

<p>
Had the men composing the brigade all
been akin to me they could not have shown
greater kindness, nor done more to soothe
my grief, than they did during the brief
time before the march toward the Tory
encampment was really commenced.
</p>

<p>
One found immediately a better steed;
another brought assurances from Captain
Mouzon that I was not to think for a single
instant of the loss of his horses, since it
was only the fortunes of war, which must
be expected. A third would have pressed
food upon me; but I could not have swallowed
a single morsel unless, perchance,
life itself might have depended upon the
act.
</p>

<p>
My uncle, Major James, said very little
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_97' name='Page_97'>[97]</a></span>
after hearing the story we had gotten from
Sam Lee.
</p>

<p>
At first I attributed his silence to the apprehensions
which had come upon him
with the knowledge that General Gates
had been overwhelmed; but later I had
good reason to believe it arose solely from
anxiety concerning my brother.
</p>

<p>
"You shall ride by my side, lad, until
we have settled this affair, and when it is
done neither you nor I will have cause to
reproach ourselves for not having ventured
enough."
</p>

<p>
Such a promise from such a man was
sufficient to tell me that while he and I remained
alive, we would struggle as men do
who have no fear of death, until the dear lad
was rescued, or we borne down by press of
numbers.
</p>

<p>
At this day it seems singular to me that
I heard no one speak of the great disaster
which had come upon the colonists at
Camden.
</p>

<p>
I can only explain it by the supposition
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_98' name='Page_98'>[98]</a></span>
that each man saw in the adventure before
us an opportunity to do somewhat by
way of retaliation, and set all his thoughts
on that purpose.
</p>

<p>
We were halted, after my rejoining the
brigade, twenty minutes or more, and then
the word to advance was given; but not
in such fashion as I had supposed from
what General Marion said, on his learning
of the disaster which had come upon
Percy.
</p>

<p>
My idea was, and in my ignorance I saw
no other method of procedure, that the little
troop would ride into Barfield's Tories even
as they had among those commanded by
Major Gainey, and that we should profit
by the surprise.
</p>

<p>
This could not be done, as I afterward
came to realize.
</p>

<p>
The capture of Percy, and what Sam Lee
could tell, would be sufficient to prevent us
from coming upon them unexpectedly.
</p>

<p>
When the Tory lad should inform the
commander that two of Major James'
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_99' name='Page_99'>[99]</a></span>
nephews were in that vicinity, it would be
immediately known that our uncle, with
a goodly following, was somewhere nearabout.
</p>

<p>
The Tories would be prepared, and those
who had suffered defeat that morning must
have, by this time, a very good idea of our
strength.
</p>

<p>
General Marion, as I afterward came to
know full well, was not the man to neglect
any precaution, and while he counted on
making an attack despite the difference in
numbers, it was his intention to do so in
such manner as would come nearest to
guaranteeing success.
</p>

<p>
Fifty of the best mounted men were
detached and sent straight toward Dubose
Ferry, while the remainder of the brigade
rode off at right angles, in such direction
as would bring us to the timber lands
eastward of the road leading to Indian
Village.
</p>

<p>
It was this last portion of the force which
my uncle and I accompanied, and I, surprised
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_100' name='Page_100'>[100]</a></span>
that a part of the brigade rode at full
speed, while we loitered, as it were, asked
the reason.
</p>

<p>
"Those in advance are mounted in such
fashion that they may easily outrun the
enemy, and it is the plan that they appear
before Barfield's force as if intending
to make an attack," my uncle replied.
"After thus showing themselves the
squad will beat a retreat, causing it to
appear as if they were surprised by seeing
so large a force. Then, unless the Tories
are quicker witted than I give them credit
for being, a goodly portion of the band will
be led into ambush."
</p>

<p>
It was the Indian's favorite method of
warfare, and, cruel though I had ever considered
it, at this moment it gave me most
intense pleasure.
</p>

<p>
I had said to myself that we could hope
to do little less than die in the vain attempt
to rescue Percy; but now it seemed as if,
should our lives be demanded as a sacrifice,
we might sell them dearly.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_101' name='Page_101'>[101]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Well, all went as our commander had
counted upon.
</p>

<p>
We hid ourselves in the thicket either
side the road, three hundred and fifty
horsemen, with not a man dismounted, for
we counted upon riding the Tories down
when they should retreat after the first
volley had warned them that they had been
led into a trap.
</p>

<p>
There we waited upwards of an hour, no
man venturing to so much as speak, and
each looking well after his steed lest one
of the animals whinny at the supreme
moment, thus giving the enemy a clew,
before they were fairly within our grasp,
of what awaited them.
</p>

<p>
During that hour I resolutely kept my
thoughts on trifles, such as caring for the
animal I bestrode, making certain I was in
such position that it would be possible to get
out of the wood with the least possible delay
when the enemy was thrown into confusion,
and by these and other means prevented
myself from dwelling upon Percy's fate.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_102' name='Page_102'>[102]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Then came that sound for which we had
waited&mdash;the thunder of horses' feet upon
the beaten road.
</p>

<p>
We heard cries of fear, which were uttered
by our decoys to entice the Tories into
yet hotter pursuit, and far in the distance
could be distinguished the crack of rifles
and the rattle of muskets.
</p>

<p>
At that time, with the blood literally
boiling in my veins and my heart beating
like the blows of a hammer, I never stopped
to question how many of ours might be
killed in this attempt to deal out punishment
to the enemies of the colonies; but
realized only that now was come the
moment when I could strike a blow in
defense of my brother.
</p>

<p>
Nearer and nearer came the horsemen,
until through the trees we saw the Williamsburg
men riding madly down, not a
saddle emptied, and before one could count
twenty the advance of the Tories came
in sight.
</p>

<p>
A whispered word went around among
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_103' name='Page_103'>[103]</a></span>
us to "hold ready," although every man
was on the alert, and when the road in
front of us appeared to be one dense mass
of horses, and men wearing red uniforms,
my uncle gave the signal for which we
waited:
</p>

<p>
"Fire, boys, and at them!"
</p>

<p>
From each side the road rang out reports
of rifles which had been leveled in deadly
aim, for at such short range each could pick
his man and make certain of bringing him
down.
</p>

<p>
Instantly the ranks were broken; the
redcoated horsemen reined in their steeds
as the squad they had been pursuing halted
and fired their volley, and then came a
scramble and retreat when we dashed
among them.
</p>

<p>
Twice I loaded and discharged my rifle,
and then it seemed to me as if such work
was all too slow.
</p>

<p>
Using the weapon as a club, I rode by
my uncle's side into the very midst of that
scrambling, terrified mass of human beings,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_104' name='Page_104'>[104]</a></span>
and cried aloud with savage joy when
I struck one of the frightened villains
down.
</p>

<p>
As was afterward learned, there were
no less than one thousand men who had
set out in pursuit of our decoys, and yet
after our first attack not one of them
remained to hold us in check.
</p>

<p>
Had they been only so many sheep, we
could not have found them easier prey.
</p>

<p>
The major, my uncle, had said I should
ride by his side, and so I did, down the
road at the heels of the Tory scoundrels,
ever as we had done the night previous.
Then on, and on, striking down a foe here
and there until we were come, nearly the
whole brigade, into that encampment
which Gavin Witherspoon and I had looked
upon, believing it could not be taken by
such a force as ours.
</p>

<p>
Out of all those scoundrels who had so
lately held the place, believing that those
true to the Cause had been virtually
crushed by the defeat of General Gates,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_105' name='Page_105'>[105]</a></span>
only two men came forth to meet us, and
those two, my brother and Gavin Witherspoon.
</p>

<p>
Is there any need I should say how warm
was the greeting between us two lads when
I threw myself from the horse and clasped
to my heart the dear boy whom I had
thought never to see again in this life?
</p>

<p>
It needed no more than an hundred
words for him to tell his story.
</p>

<p>
While he remained in the thicket guarding
Sam Lee a body of men, who had lately
served under Major Gainey, came upon
them by chance, and, as a matter of course,
he was at once taken prisoner, Sam Lee
immediately telling the story of his own
capture.
</p>

<p>
Then it was the Tory Sam who became
the jailer, and Percy the prisoner.
</p>

<p>
My brother was conducted to Barfield's
camp, and there kept under guard of Sam,
who did all that lay in his power, save by
way of personal violence, to pay off old
scores.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_106' name='Page_106'>[106]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Gavin Witherspoon, wily as an Indian,
had crept up to the very edge of the encampment,
and was lying there in the
vain hope that some opportunity would
come for the rescue, when our force, sent
as a decoy, appeared.
</p>

<p>
An hundred or more men were left to
guard the encampment, and Gavin hoped
the moment had come when he might be
of service to the lad.
</p>

<p>
Believing that the Tories would be victorious
in the chase, because of superior
numbers, he ventured too near Percy, and
was himself captured.
</p>

<p>
An hour later the first of the terrified
fugitives burst into the encampment, riding
straight through it in their wild terror,
thus causing a panic among the guard
who might even then, because of their
intrenched position, have held us in check.
</p>

<p>
In a twinkling Percy and Gavin were
free; but in imminent danger of being
ridden down by the panic-stricken.
</p>

<p>
Crouching behind trees, or at the stronger
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_107' name='Page_107'>[107]</a></span>
portions of the intrenchments, they awaited
our coming, and when we rode into camp
came forth to greet us as I have said.
</p>

<p>
Our force remained in the captured
quarters until next morning, and during
the evening Gavin Witherspoon, Percy and
myself had much to talk about.
</p>

<p>
My brother and I were come by this time
to look upon the old man as a comrade,
and well we might, after the friend he had
proven himself to be.
</p>

<p>
While we talked only concerning ourselves,
and looked after our own welfare,
General Marion and the officers of the
command spent the time discussing how
it might be possible for so small a force to
uphold the cause in the Carolinas, for since
the defeat of Gates ours was the only
body of men in the colony to oppose the
foe.
</p>

<p>
It was as if the king's troops had indeed
crushed what they were pleased to term
"rebellion," and more than one man in the
brigade whose fidelity to the Cause could
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_108' name='Page_108'>[108]</a></span>
not be questioned, asked his comrade if it
were wise to longer remain in arms when
we were virtually whipped.
</p>

<p>
The outlook was gloomy indeed for those
who had hoped to be freed from the burdens
the king had put upon them; but, fortunately
for the Cause, General Marion and
Major James were not the men to give in
beaten so long as life remained.
</p>

<p>
Even while some among us were making
ready to say openly that the time had come
when we must submit, those two gallant
gentlemen were planning for the future&mdash;planning
as to how four hundred or less
might best oppose ten times their number
of trained soldiers.
</p>

<p>
Gavin Witherspoon, Percy and myself,
while listening to the faint-hearted ones or
discussing the situation between ourselves,
hoped that the general would call upon us
for some especial mission, even as he had
when we were sent to spy out Barfield's
camp; but the time was not come when
we were needed for a venture of any
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_109' name='Page_109'>[109]</a></span>
moment, as we learned an hour before
daybreak next morning.
</p>

<p>
Then the men were aroused with orders
to breakfast from the Tories' provisions as
hurriedly as might be, and make ready for
the forced march.
</p>

<p>
Among those with whom I talked, when
in the gray light we made our preparations
for the march, not a man believed there
was the slightest question we should continue
upon the offensive.
</p>

<p>
All understood that we could not in
safety remain much longer in the Tory
camp, for unless those whom we had routed
were greater cowards than was generally
believed, they would soon recover from the
panic into which we had driven them, and
return to make an attack.
</p>

<p>
Therefore it was that we set out believing
the move was made simply for the purpose
of changing quarters, and when orders
were given that each man take from the
Tory stores so much of provisions for himself,
or provender for his horse as could be
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_110' name='Page_110'>[110]</a></span>
carried conveniently behind him, we fancied
it was the general's purpose to so outfit
the brigade that it might lay in hiding
two or three days without being forced to
venture forth in search of food.
</p>

<p>
Before noon came, however, all understood
that some maneuver was in progress.
</p>

<p>
Instead of riding rapidly, as would have
been the case had we counted on simply
exchanging one encampment for another,
we went forward at a leisurely pace, making
no halt until the sun was high in the
heavens, when we were come to the ford
on Black River, half a dozen miles or more
south of Kingstree.
</p>

<p>
Then the men and horses were allowed
a rest of an hour, after which we bore
nearly due west until we struck the road
leading from Georgetown to Nelson's
Ferry, and the word was whispered from
man to man that the commander had it in
mind to strike yet another blow at the
red-coated enemy before we laid down our
arms.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_111' name='Page_111'>[111]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
It is well known, as a matter of course,
that the "war-path" from Charleston to
Camden crosses Santee River at Nelson's
Ferry, and here, above all other places,
would one who was eager for fighting be
likely to get his fill.
</p>

<p>
More than once during the day had we
learned from planters, who were true to the
Cause, additional particulars concerning
the blunder of General Gates, and before
nightfall we understood beyond a peradventure
that the story told by Sam Lee was
only untrue in so far as it did not contain
all the disasters which had befallen the
American arms.
</p>

<p>
Now we knew how many prisoners had
been taken, and, what was more to the
purpose, learned that our unfortunate
countrymen were being sent as rapidly as
possible from the scene of the one-sided
conflict to Charleston.
</p>

<p>
It was an hour before sunset, and we
were holding the same pace at which we
started, with no evidence of going into
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_112' name='Page_112'>[112]</a></span>
camp, when Gavin Witherspoon said bitterly,
as if the thought had just seized
him:
</p>

<p>
"Lads, if it so be you have any curiosity
concerning this long march of ours, during
which we have traversed the Williamsburg
district apparently for no other purpose than
to come upon an enemy who may crush us
with but little trouble, I can satisfy you."
</p>

<p>
"Have you been getting some special
information?" Percy asked with a laugh.
</p>

<p>
"Aye, lad, that I have, and you may count
upon its being true, although I got it only
from my own head."
</p>

<p>
"Then you are guessing as to where we
are going?" I said with no great show of
enthusiasm, for I was weary to the verge
of exhaustion with long remaining in the
saddle.
</p>

<p>
"It is more than guessing, lad. It is
what has been learned from observation,
and that is the most reliable information
a man can obtain. We are heading for
Nelson's Ferry."
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_113' name='Page_113'>[113]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"If that is all your observation has
taught you, it would seem as if much time
had been wasted," Percy replied laughingly.
"Every man in the brigade has
known as much since noon."
</p>

<p>
"True, lad, but that is not the sum of the
information I am willing to give. It has
been told us that the American prisoners
which Lord Cornwallis took are being sent
to Charleston as rapidly as possible, and
you will admit with me that all must
pass through this same place toward
which we are bound. It is General
Marion's purpose to strike another blow,
if no more, at the enemy, and in so
doing set free some of those who were
made prisoners through their general's
stupidity."
</p>

<p>
There was much of sound common sense
in Gavin Witherspoon's reasoning, and
straightway the truth of it came into my
mind, all sense of fatigue was lost sight of
in the relief which was mine at knowing
we would not yet submit to the Britishers,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_114' name='Page_114'>[114]</a></span>
even though it seemed as if we were
already driven to the last extremity.
</p>

<p>
A moment before the old man gave
words to his thoughts, I would have said
that both the animal I bestrode and myself
were so near to exhaustion that we could
not hold the pace an hour longer; but now
it was as if I had enjoyed a long time of
repose, and action was absolutely necessary,
lest I grow rusty with much idleness.
</p>

<p>
We three discussed the possibility of the
future as if all Gavin Witherspoon had
suggested was known to be true, until one
of the general's aides came riding down
the line, drawing rein in front of us, as he
said curtly:
</p>

<p>
"The general would speak with you."
</p>

<p>
"We have not been forgotten," Percy
cried gleefully, "and now has come our
time to render some immediate service."
</p>

<p>
"Or fall into the hands of the enemy,"
Gavin Witherspoon added with a smile.
"These special missions are not the safest,
and sometimes he who sets out on them
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_115' name='Page_115'>[115]</a></span>
with the idea of making his name famous,
comes to grief."
</p>

<p>
"As I did yesterday," Percy replied, still
laughing. "When I have as comrades you
and Bob, it matters little how much of
unpleasant adventure I see, save for the
discomfort of the moment."
</p>

<p>
Then the dear lad spurred his horse onward,
and we two followed, Gavin Witherspoon
wearing a serious countenance, while
I was in much perplexity as to whether two
lads like Percy and myself should be trusted
with work such as old soldiers oftentimes
fail at doing successfully.
</p>

<p>
Arriving at the head of the line we found
the general and Major James riding side
by side.
</p>

<p>
Both returned our salute, but neither
slackened speed, and we rode alongside of
the general, Percy and I, while Gavin remained
slightly in the rear.
</p>

<p>
"We should be within twenty miles of
Nelson's Ferry," the commander said,
speaking as if we were eager for such
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_116' name='Page_116'>[116]</a></span>
information. "It is certain that portions
of Cornwallis's force guarding American
prisoners will pass there from time to time
within the next eight and forty hours. It
is my desire that we have early information
of such coming and going, and to that
end I have sent for you, lads."
</p>

<p>
He paused for an instant as if debating
in his mind what to say next, and Gavin
Witherspoon rode up that he might attract
the general's attention, when the latter said
with a smile:
</p>

<p>
"I am speaking to you two lads and the
old man who is so eager to participate in
venturesome missions. Any force coming
from Camden will halt over night, at least,
nearabout the Ferry. By riding up the
river ten miles or more you should be able
to give me timely information of their
coming. Within an hour we shall halt,
and then it is you who must push forward
so far as the animals can go. Continue on
until having come to a point ten or twelve
miles above the Ferry. There remain, in
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_117' name='Page_117'>[117]</a></span>
whatsoever fashion may please you, until
you hear of the enemy's approach. Then
wait only so long as may be necessary to
learn how strong he is in numbers, after
which you will ride without delay to Taw
Caw Creek, on the bank of which we shall
be encamped."
</p>

<p>
Having said this he saluted, as did my
uncle, and we three, understanding that
this was the signal for dismissal, reined
in our steeds until we were fallen back to
our proper place in the line.
</p>

<p>
The knowledge that we were to perform
some especial work which bid fair to be of
service to the Cause, heartened us wonderfully,
and indeed we had need of something
to raise our courage, for much talking
about the disasters which had overtaken
the American troops caused it to seem
as if the so-called rebellion was well-nigh
come to an end.
</p>

<p>
"It may be our last chance of striking
a blow at those who represent the king,
lads," Gavin Witherspoon said cheerily.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_118' name='Page_118'>[118]</a></span>
"Mayhap we shall be fortunate if a British
bullet finds lodgment in our bodies with
sufficient force to wipe us out of existence,
for such a death as that is preferable to
hanging, and that is what awaits us of
Williamsburg who defy his majesty, after
my Lord Clinton's second proclamation."
</p>

<p>
"It is a doleful way you have of preparing
one for venturesome work," Percy said,
with a laugh which told that he claimed
little share in these forebodings. "If to
be shot is good fortune, then we may rejoice,
for I doubt not but that there are
hundreds of the king's servants who will
readily grant such a favor."
</p>

<p>
"I am not minded to dishearten you,"
Gavin said in a kindly tone; "but the
straits into which the Cause has fallen are
so sore and desperate now, that to an old
man like me who has ventured all, it would
seem as if a soldier's death, coming before
the last blow to the colonies had been
struck, was a kindly thing. However, we
are like to go ten miles above Nelson's
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_119' name='Page_119'>[119]</a></span>
Ferry and back, without falling into more
harm than was brought about by the capture
of Sam Lee, and I venture to say we
shall report in proper form and due time
such information as the general desires."
</p>

<p>
Then we fell silent, each intent on his
own thoughts, and at that moment I was
thinking far more of my mother than of
the Cause, for Gavin Witherspoon's words
had depressed me until it began to appear
as if I might never see her dear face
again.
</p>

<p>
From this pleasant but yet painful reverie
I was roused by the halting of the command,
and Percy said, seizing me by the arm as
if believing I had fallen asleep:
</p>

<p>
"The time has come for us to push forward
alone, Bob, and we must make as
many miles 'twixt now and dark as can be
forced out of these jaded steeds."
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_120' name='Page_120'>[120]</a></span>
</p>

<h2>
CHAPTER VI.<br />
<span class="s08">THE PRISONERS.</span></h2>

<p>
Giving no heed to those around us, we
continued on when the command was
halted, much as if we had not heard the
orders, and without anything in the way
of leave-taking.
</p>

<p>
I know not how it may have been with
my companions; but as for myself, I was
in no mood to speak even with my uncle,
so thickly did the sad and gloomy thoughts
flow through my mind. It was to me as
if we were playing the last acts in that
drama which should have had a glorious
ending&mdash;as if we were assisting at the
death of the Cause, and I believe that nine
out of every ten men in the brigade had
some such thought as myself.
</p>

<p>
It was true that we might strike a blow
at Nelson's Ferry, but let the reader remember
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_121' name='Page_121'>[121]</a></span>
that ours was probably the only
armed force, true to the colonies, then in
the Carolinas; let him remember that the
Britishers overran our land, even as did
the locusts of old, and how might four
hundred men or less oppose all the soldiers
the king could send against us?
</p>

<p>
Surely for us of the southern colonies,
this night, when we three set out to spy
upon the victorious troops coming down
from Camden with our friends as prisoners,
was the worst ever known.
</p>

<p>
We were beaten&mdash;hemmed in, and, like
rats in the corner, could only make one
desperate fight, not against death, but
simply as proof that our courage held
good even to the very last moment.
</p>

<p>
Let all these things be borne well in
mind, and it is little wonder that when
we rode on after the command was halted,
we were in no mood for leave-taking.
Ours might, and it seemed probable it
would, be the last blow in a gallant struggle
for liberty.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_122' name='Page_122'>[122]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
When we passed the group of officers
at the head of the column, all sitting their
horses motionless as statues, looking
neither to the right nor the left, but each
man as it were peering into the recesses
of his own heart, asking himself in what
way the end would come, I gave one glance
toward my uncle, and it seemed to me as
if there was a certain uplifting of the eyebrows
which I interpreted as a "good-by."
</p>

<p>
More than that we saw not, and five
minutes later the brigade of Williamsburg
patriots, tried and true, were left behind,
while we two lads and the old man rode
forward, hoping almost against hope that
it might be possible we should accomplish
something toward showing the British
king how strong in our hearts was the
desire for liberty.
</p>

<p>
Our horses, jaded by the long march of
the day, were unwilling to leave the troop;
they went forward listlessly, and we had
not the heart to spur them on because it
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_123' name='Page_123'>[123]</a></span>
was much as if they shared our feelings.
</p>

<p>
I question if we gained ten miles in advance
of the column that night.
</p>

<p>
Certain it is we were not yet come within
the vicinity of Nelson's Ferry when
Gavin Witherspoon's horse stopped short,
and the old man said as he dismounted
slowly:
</p>

<p>
"We may as well rest here for the night,
as a mile or two further on. I propose that
we halt until a couple of hours before sunrise,
and by so doing we shall gain time."
</p>

<p>
After the experience we had had with
the old man, Percy and I were more than
willing to follow his advice, and we set
about making ourselves as comfortable as
might be under all the circumstances.
</p>

<p>
A better place for camping could not
be found. A tiny brook running through
a grove of pines, where the underbrush
was so dense as to form ample hiding-place,
as well as a shelter from the dews of the
night. There was little green feed for the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_124' name='Page_124'>[124]</a></span>
horses; but we carried a goodly store of
grain on our saddles, and, heedless of the
possible necessities of the future which
seemed so dark, we allowed the tired steeds
to eat their pleasure from the store.
</p>

<p>
Such food as we had, and as I have said
was taken from the Tory camp, we ate, and
then, lame and sore in every joint from the
long hours in the saddle, we laid ourselves
down for perchance the last sleep on this
earth.
</p>

<p>
My eyes were closed in slumber within
two or three minutes after I was thus
stretched at full length upon the bed of pine
needles, and it seemed as if I had slept
several hours when something&mdash;I know
not what&mdash;awakened me.
</p>

<p>
There was no movement, and the faint
light of the stars did not penetrate the
thicket; yet I could see that the horses
were lying down; that my comrades were
wrapped in slumber, and it puzzled me to
make out why I was thus wakeful.
</p>

<p>
Then, partially turning my head, for no
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_125' name='Page_125'>[125]</a></span>
other reason than to make a change of
position, I saw what appeared to be the reflection
of a camp-fire through the underbrush.
</p>

<p>
When one knows that he is surrounded
by enemies, the lightest thing out of the
ordinary arouses his suspicions, and although
this gleam of light was so faint
that at another time I would have given
no heed to it, now it seemed absolutely
necessary I should understand the cause.
</p>

<p>
It would be foolish to awaken my comrades,
so I argued, when there might be
no good reason, and I crept out through
the bushes softly until, having traversed a
distance of fifty yards or more, when I saw
that we were not the only ones who had
utilized this thicket as a camp.
</p>

<p>
Four men sat around a small fire eating,
and near by were tethered their horses.
</p>

<p>
It was fortunate our steeds were so leg-weary,
else when this party drove up they
might have given the alarm, for I doubted
not but that these were enemies. At such
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_126' name='Page_126'>[126]</a></span>
time in the history of the so-called rebellion
we had so few friends as to be able to say
with a certainty where they were.
</p>

<p>
It was in my mind to return at once and
arouse Gavin Witherspoon and Percy, that
we might make our escape; but all was
so quiet, and these four apparently unsuspicious
that any save themselves were
in the vicinity, that I delayed carrying out
the purpose in my mind, until, having
almost unconsciously approached a few
yards nearer, I recognized in one of them,
that Tory villain, Sam Lee.
</p>

<p>
Once this discovery was made I no longer
thought of returning to where I had left
my comrades; but wriggled along yet
nearer, and was well repaid for the delay.
</p>

<p>
It would seem as if the men had been
questioning young Lee as to his ability to
do something which had been promised,
for one of them was saying when I came
within earshot:
</p>

<p>
"It is a blind chase to push ahead in
search of a party of rebels who by this
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_127' name='Page_127'>[127]</a></span>
time may have returned home, hoping to
keep secret the part they have been playing."
</p>

<p>
To this Sam Lee replied hotly, much as
if the honor of the James family were in
his keeping:
</p>

<p>
"The major will never go home alive so
long as one other can be found to remain
with him, and there are many of his kin
in Williamsburg."
</p>

<p>
"But what reason have we for believing
you can lead us to them?"
</p>

<p>
"Because I know of their haunts," the
scoundrel said, as if he was telling the
truth. "So far all they have accomplished
has been by surprising our people who are
not soldiers; but I guarantee that you men
of the Prince of Wales' regiment will make
a different showing among them."
</p>

<p>
"Of that I have no question; but these
people, knowing fully the country, can
easily disperse between the time we come
upon them, and word has been sent to the
command. Then again, we must trust to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_128' name='Page_128'>[128]</a></span>
your finding them, which I misdoubt
greatly, else are you a keener lad than I
have seen in the Carolinas."
</p>

<p>
It was the eldest of the three men who
said this, and as he moved slightly I saw
that his uniform, which I knew full well,
was that of the Prince of Wales' regiment,
to which organization Sam Lee had referred.
</p>

<p>
"You may do as you please," the young
Troy said angrily. "I have told the colonel
that I could lead you to where the scarecrow
Marion was encamped and put you
on their trail wheresoever the forces
might be going; but if, now that we are
hardly more than started, you choose to
turn back, it is none of my affair, I have
done my part."
</p>

<p>
No reply was made to this, and for a
time the men were silent, while I, speculating
as to what might be their purpose, believed
it was a simple matter to guess why
they were there.
</p>

<p>
We knew full well that Sam Lee had been
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_129' name='Page_129'>[129]</a></span>
in Captain Barfield's encampment, and, like
the coward that he was, fled when our
troops came up. He also must have ridden
all day in order to gain Nelson's Ferry; had
most likely met this regiment of the king's,
and claimed ability to deliver our people
into their hands. It seemed also true that
these troopers had ridden in advance of the
command, as had we three, and we were
thus come together at a place midway between
the Britishers and our own force.
</p>

<p>
Up to this point I had no difficulty in
forming a satisfactory conclusion; but beyond
that I was all at sea, and naturally
thought the proper course was to return
and give information to Gavin Witherspoon.
</p>

<p>
In fact I was in the act of turning when
one of the soldiers said grumblingly:
</p>

<p>
"Even though the rebels may be where
this lad has stated, I fail to see why we
should have left the camp and ridden half
a dozen miles in advance. What good can
be gained by spending the night here,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_130' name='Page_130'>[130]</a></span>
when we might have done so with our
comrades?"
</p>

<p>
"For my part," the third trooper added,
"I would rather sleep here than do my share
of guarding an hundred or more scurvy
rebels. Had we stayed in camp some
portion of the duty would have come upon
us, whereas we may lie down under these
bushes and sleep until it pleases us to open
our eyes next morning."
</p>

<p>
"That is all very true," the first speaker
replied; "yet there were good quarters to
be found at Nelson's Ferry, and here a bed
upon the ground is the best to be had."
</p>

<p>
It was almost with difficulty that I suppressed
a cry of triumph, for now I had
the full story, and we might return with
the information desired by General Marion
before having fairly set out to do the
work.
</p>

<p>
The British force, comprised in whole or
in part of the Prince of Wales' regiment,
and guarding an hundred or more of our
people, captured when General Gates was
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_131' name='Page_131'>[131]</a></span>
defeated, were encamped at Nelson's Ferry,
six or seven miles away. These fellows,
through information given by Sam Lee,
were coming out in search of us, and would
not leave their halting-place until sunrise.
</p>

<p>
It was a lucky chance which led us to
this spot, and the forebodings which had
weighed heavily upon me a few hours previous,
were lightened wonderfully by the
thought that fortune, which had borne so
hardly upon us in the past, was about taking
a turn in our favor.
</p>

<p>
I lost no time in returning at once to my
comrades, although forced to do so slowly
lest I make so much of noise that the Tory
and his red-coated companions be warned
of our nearness.
</p>

<p>
Then, having arrived by the side of Percy
and Gavin Witherspoon, I pressed both
hands upon their mouths to prevent any
cry in their awakening.
</p>

<p>
The old man's grasp upon my arm told
that he was fully alive to the situation,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_132' name='Page_132'>[132]</a></span>
and I repeated as quickly as might be all
that had been heard.
</p>

<p>
Sitting bolt upright as if any future
movement depended wholly upon me, he
said in a whisper:
</p>

<p>
"Whether the horses can cover sixteen
or twenty miles after a long day's work, is
a question."
</p>

<p>
"But one which you should not ask,"
Percy added in a more serious tone than I
had ever heard him employ. "We have
gained the information for which we were
sent, and it must be carried back to camp
without delay."
</p>

<p>
"I grant you that, lad; but was only
asking myself whether it might be possible
for our people to take advantage of
it."
</p>

<p>
"Such speculations can be deferred until
we have spoken with General Marion,"
Percy replied as he arose, and after that
there was no discussion among us.
</p>

<p>
To get the horses on their feet without
making a noise was no slight task; but
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_133' name='Page_133'>[133]</a></span>
we accomplished it after a certain fashion,
and led them out of the thicket, not mounting
until we were fully two miles away.
</p>

<p>
After that our progress was no more
rapid than if we had remained on foot, for
it seemed impossible to urge the animals
at a pace faster than a walk, and it appeared
to me as if the morning must be
near at hand when we were finally come
to the encampment.
</p>

<p>
All our men were not given over to
slumber, as was shown by our being
challenged before yet we knew how near
to us was the military force, and five
minutes later we were standing beside
our uncle, who, suddenly aroused from his
sleep, asked with a note of alarm in his
tones:
</p>

<p>
"What disaster has befallen you?"
</p>

<p>
We soon gave him to understand that
fortune had played us a good turn, and
immediately the information was given he
became animated.
</p>

<p>
One would have said he had never known
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_134' name='Page_134'>[134]</a></span>
fatigue, to have seen him as he ran toward
where General Marion was sleeping, and,
shaking the officer into wakefulness, he
repeated in a few words our story.
</p>

<p>
I had supposed the news we brought
would cause some sensation in the camp;
but never believed it would be acted upon
so quickly.
</p>

<p>
Within fifteen minutes from the time
of our being challenged by the sentinel,
every man was in the saddle, and Percy,
Gavin Witherspoon and myself were riding
at the head of the column by my uncle's
side, in order that we might point out the
place where the soldiers and Sam Lee were
encamped.
</p>

<p>
We now learned that it was midnight;
the tired men and their horses had had six
hours of rest, and although the advance
was not rapid, we pressed forward with
greater speed than I had believed possible,
our own steeds seeming to be revived by
the companionship of the others.
</p>

<p>
Now I am come to that point in this
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_135' name='Page_135'>[135]</a></span>
story concerning which I can say but little
of my own knowledge, for certain it is that
I fell asleep even while in the saddle, and
was not conscious of anything until the
halting of my horse nearly threw me over
his head.
</p>

<p>
We had arrived within two miles of
Nelson's Ferry, and it was yet night. Unless
some unfortunate accident occurred
at the last moment, there was an opportunity
of our soon learning whether the
British regulars would hold firm under
such a surprise as we should be able to
give them.
</p>

<p>
The purpose of the halt was not to reconnoiter,
as I had at first supposed, but
in order that a squad of twenty might be
detached to gain possession of the road in
the swamp at that post known as Horse
Creek, while we were to attack the main
body in the rear.
</p>

<p>
The scouts who had been sent ahead
half an hour before my awakening, came
back reporting that the enemy were encamped
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_136' name='Page_136'>[136]</a></span>
on the east bank of the creek,
which was another and a great point in
our favor.
</p>

<p>
Once more would General Marion have a
chance to execute his favorite maneuver,
the only one by which we could hope to
win while the odds were so heavily against
us.
</p>

<p>
Twenty minutes or more were spent
here waiting for the detachment to get into
position at Horse Creek, and then the
advance was resumed, this time at a slow
pace lest the thud of our horses' feet upon
the road should give an alarm.
</p>

<p>
Despite the fact that I knew full well
we would soon be engaged in deadly encounter,
slumber weighed heavily upon
my eyelids, and it was with difficulty I
could prevent them from closing.
</p>

<p>
Rather like one in a dream, than a lad
who burned to give his life for the Cause,
did I hold myself in the saddle, and it
seemed as if no more than ten minutes
had passed when we were halted again,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_137' name='Page_137'>[137]</a></span>
this time so near the enemy that the
gleam of his camp-fires could be seen.
</p>

<p>
The moment for reflection had come.
</p>

<p>
General Marion's force was about to be
hurled upon the best men in the king's
army. We who knew little or nothing of
military tactics, we who were mounted
upon jaded steeds, and half dead for lack
of sleep, were about to charge a camp of
well armed men, most likely in the best
possible condition, and if the end for us of
the southern colonies was near, it seemed
as if this was indeed the last moment.
</p>

<p>
"At full speed, and do not fire until we
are close upon them!" was the whispered
word passed from man to man, and I saw
those either side of me carefully charging
their rifles or muskets.
</p>

<p>
Even though we were come upon the
Prince of Wales' regiment and a portion of
the 63d Regulars, as was afterward
learned, the result was much the same as
when we rode down upon the undisciplined
Tories.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_138' name='Page_138'>[138]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
There was the onward leaping of the
horses as the spurs were sunk deep in their
flanks; the thunder of their hoofs; the
cries of the enemy as they were awakened
from their slumbers; our shouts of
triumph; the crackle of musketry and the
groans of the wounded.
</p>

<p>
It was a dream&mdash;a horrible nightmare
rather than a reality, and had I been a
spectator instead of a participant, it would
have seemed no different.
</p>

<p>
At such times the excitement of the
battle is full upon one, and I have yet to
see man or boy who can give a clear and
detailed account of all that occurred while
the scent of the powder was in his nostrils.
</p>

<p>
This much I do know, that, as twice before,
I loaded and discharged my musket,
or used it as a club; that I forced my horse
to keep pace with my uncle's steed, who
was ever foremost in the fray, and then
the fleeing mass told that the enemy were
in retreat.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_139' name='Page_139'>[139]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
This victory, when the majority of our
men had believed the attack would prove
our final ending, did more to revive the
drooping spirits of General Marion's force
than anything else could have done.
</p>

<p>
We forgot weariness; forgot everything
save the fact that we of Williamsburg had
been pitted against the king's best soldiers,
and were come out of the battle as well as
when we met Major Gainey's or Barfield's
men.
</p>

<p>
On this occasion, however, we did not
press the pursuit. It was known that these
soldiers would re-form, where raw recruits
might continue panic-stricken, and we were
not so strong in numbers as to risk a regular
engagement.
</p>

<p>
My uncle was the foremost here, as he
ever had been, and Percy and I remained
by his side, therefore can I say of a verity
that we did not ride after the retreating
column more than half a mile; but, once
well clear of the encampment, drew rein
and turned about.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_140' name='Page_140'>[140]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
It was now near to daylight, and we
soon learned that we had captured or killed
twenty-two regulars, among whom was a
captain, and held two Tories as prisoners.
</p>

<p>
Our loss was one killed and one
wounded.
</p>

<p>
In addition to having thus gained a victory
over the best of his majesty's soldiers
in the colonies, we had recaptured one
hundred and fifty men, and it is not necessary
to say how much of rejoicing there
was in our lines when the sun rose.
</p>

<p>
Now am I come to the shameful part of
the story, and one which will be most difficult
of belief.
</p>

<p>
To Percy and I it seemed that with this
successful attack, by liberating one hundred
and fifty men who were supposed to be
friends to the Cause, because of wearing
the Continental uniform, we had added
just so much to General Marion's strength,
and neither of us had any question but
that every one of them would gladly join
our force.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_141' name='Page_141'>[141]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
As we two believed, so did all our comrades
as well as the officers who led us, for
after the first rejoicings were over those
who had been prisoners were ordered into
line, and Major James proposed, with the
air of one who thinks he makes what will
be accepted without question, that they
enroll themselves among us of Williamsburg
until such time as we could fight our
way through the district to where others
who loved the Cause might be found.
</p>

<p>
To the shame of these Continental soldiers
it must be set down that out of that number
freed by us at risk of our lives, only three
consented to serve under the general.
</p>

<p>
Some said that the "Cause was lost;"
others declared that to fight longer was
"simply to risk one's life without an object,
because the king's troops overrun the
country, and after the defeat of Gates there
was no longer the slightest chance we could
hold our own many days."
</p>

<p>
When no more than these three stepped
forward from the ranks in response to his
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_142' name='Page_142'>[142]</a></span>
proposal, and the others talked loudly
among themselves, or with our men, my
uncle turned away like one who is stricken
with a deadly wound.
</p>

<p>
Then Percy and I made our way among
these men who wore the buff and the blue,
to hear further reasons as to why they had
acted such a cowardly part.
</p>

<p>
It was a captain, one who should have
been the first to urge his men to enlist, who
said in reply to my questions:
</p>

<p>
"Surely the Cause has none in the Carolinas,
save this beggarly force to which
you are attached, while the British have
overrun this section of the country. The
Continentals are dispersed or captured; the
Virginia and North Carolina militia are
scattered to the four winds; Sumter's
Legion has been whipped by Tarleton, and
their leader is fleeing for his life. In addition
to all that, here is a copy of the letter
which Lord Clinton has sent to the commandants
of the different posts throughout
the colonies."
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_143' name='Page_143'>[143]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Then the officer handed me a slip of paper
on which was written the following:
</p>

<p>
"I have given orders that all of the inhabitants
of this province who have subscribed,
and have taken part in this revolt,
should be punished with the greatest rigor;
and also those who will not turn out, that
they may be imprisoned and their whole
property taken from them or destroyed....
I have ordered in the most positive
manner that every militiaman, who has
borne arms with us, and afterwards joined
the enemy, shall be immediately hanged!"
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_144' name='Page_144'>[144]</a></span>
</p>

<h2>
CHAPTER VII.<br />
<span class="s08">THE RETREAT.</span></h2>

<p>
We of Williamsburg were most certainly
in a peculiar position, after having released
one hundred and fifty prisoners and discovered
that only three had sufficient faith in
the Cause, or were sufficiently eager for
death, to join us.
</p>

<p>
Now right here let me set down that the
men under General Marion were true patriots,
gentlemen of the Williamsburg district,
and in every sense of the word, worthy
citizens. This I say because the British
people even at this late day, five years since
peace was declared and we have become a
free and independent people, say that "that
officer who caused Tarleton so much annoyance
had as a following only the dissolute
and depraved."
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_145' name='Page_145'>[145]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
I repeat, the force under General Marion
was made up of gentlemen, the greater
number of whom owned plantations in or
near the Williamsburg district, and the
fact that they had for a leader such a man
as my uncle, Major James, is sufficient
proof as to their character.
</p>

<p>
Although these men were by this time
come to believe that the Cause for which
they had struggled so long was much the
same as lost, so far as we in the southern
colonies were concerned, yet they were not
of the class that acknowledges itself beaten
while life remains.
</p>

<p>
Therefore it was, that instead of being
yet further disheartened by this failure
which followed a brilliant victory, they
were the more determined to strike every
possible blow before the end should come.
</p>

<p>
The cruel and barbarous proclamation of
Lord Clinton aroused their anger rather
than fear, and within half an hour after it
had been circulated among us, I heard my
uncle, the major, say that no document
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_146' name='Page_146'>[146]</a></span>
could have been put in a style better calculated
to drive recruits into our ranks
than that which was written evidently for
the purpose of frightening the colony into
submission.
</p>

<p>
There is, perhaps, a good word to be
spoken for those men, who, having been
released from captivity by us, were willing
to serve under General Marion.
</p>

<p>
They had been whipped at the very moment
victory seemed certain, and it is little
wonder that the faint-hearted should have
begun to despair, when, after four years of
desperate struggling, the "rebellion" was
well-nigh crushed out.
</p>

<p>
At the moment, we of Williamsburg
could have no sympathy for such cowards,
as we called them, and had any of the men
begged us for food I question if we would
have supplied their wants, so angered were
we by the refusal to enlist.
</p>

<p>
It was evident to every man among us
that it was not safe to remain on this road
over which the British soldiers were continually
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_147' name='Page_147'>[147]</a></span>
passing, and particularly since
those whom we had defeated would speedily
give information to all the king's officers
in the colony.
</p>

<p>
From this hour our little brigade would
be hunted down without mercy, and there
could be no question but that the chase
would be a lively one since the Britishers
in this section had no other "rebels" with
whom to occupy their attention.
</p>

<p>
Therefore it was that every man in the
command felt a certain sense of relief,
when, after a halt of no more than four
hours, word was given to remount the tired
horses.
</p>

<p>
We rode four hours or more, and then
were come to the forest round about Hope
Mountain, when the word was given that
we would have an opportunity to indulge
in a long rest.
</p>

<p>
During this march it can well be imagined
that Gavin Witherspoon, Percy and myself
kept a sharp lookout for Sam Lee. The
greatest desire in my heart at that moment
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_148' name='Page_148'>[148]</a></span>
was to make a prisoner of the young Tory,
for he, knowing well every man in the
brigade, would be able to give the Britishers
many valuable hints regarding our probable
whereabouts, and so long as he remained
at liberty we had a dangerous
enemy afoot, even though that enemy was
a coward.
</p>

<p>
Every man, including officers, brought
away with him from this last encounter a
goodly store of provisions, and there was
no fear of suffering from lack of food, even
though we remained a week in this encampment
at the foot of the mountain.
</p>

<p>
The days were passed in perfect idleness,
save so far as the grooming of our horses
was concerned, and, although not a trooper
left the camp, we were kept well informed
regarding the movements of the enemy,
by such of the people round about as were
friendly to the Cause.
</p>

<p>
Therefore it was that we heard sad news
from Camden when the humane and chivalrous
Lord Cornwallis hanged eight old
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_149' name='Page_149'>[149]</a></span>
men and seven boys, prisoners whom he
had taken after the battle, simply because
there was a suspicion that they might
have been concerned in the so-called rebellion.
</p>

<p>
Nor was this wholesale murder the only
crime committed by the conquerors in the
Carolinas during the week we remained
idle.
</p>

<p>
From every quarter came stories of
barbarity and excesses committed by
British officers, and that which seemed like
a great misfortune soon proved, despite
the horror, to be a blessing in disguise, for
it drove into our ranks every man from
the surrounding country who had ever
been charged, whether rightfully or no,
with taking any part whatsoever in the
resistance to the king's oppressions.
</p>

<p>
Within six days there were enrolled
among the followers of General Marion no
less than seven hundred and fifty good men
and true; but it is not to be supposed that
such number remained in camp.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_150' name='Page_150'>[150]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
In fact, although the brigade was being
strengthened daily, the force under arms
was decreasing, and for two good reasons:
First, because such a body could not readily
be supplied with provisions, and secondly,
because the majority of these troopers
were men of families, who, during this
season of inactivity, took advantage of the
opportunity to provide for the wants of
those at home.
</p>

<p>
No more than one hundred and fifty remained
in the camp at Hope Mountain;
but the others stood ready to respond to
the first summons that their service was
needed.
</p>

<p>
It was late in the evening of the eighth
day, when one on whose fidelity to the
Cause we could rely, came into camp with
the information that Tarleton's Legion and
a strong force under Major Wemyss, had
been sent by Lord Cornwallis against us.
</p>

<p>
Although his lordship had affected to despise
General Marion, he certainly acted
as if he believed our commander a gallant
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_151' name='Page_151'>[151]</a></span>
officer, otherwise why were the 63d
Regulars and the Legion of Tarleton sent
against what the Britishers had contemptuously
termed "that beggarly crew."
</p>

<p>
Before morning other friends came into
camp, and we knew that the two forces
were not as yet united; but Major Wemyss
with the 63d Regulars, and a large body
of Tories under Major Harrison, were
advancing rapidly toward Hope Mountain,
information of our whereabouts having
been given, perhaps, by that young scoundrel,
Sam Lee, who I doubted not was doing
his best to work us harm.
</p>

<p>
Although there was much in this information
to dishearten, I believe every member
of our small band felt a certain sense
of satisfaction that the time for action was
near at hand. None of us had doubted but
that we should be employed against the
enemy in some manner, despite the great
difference in numbers.
</p>

<p>
Gavin Witherspoon, Percy and I were so
fortunate as to be among the fifty selected
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_152' name='Page_152'>[152]</a></span>
to reconnoiter, and when we saddled our
horses, which were in prime condition after
their long halt, there was a certain sense
of exultation in our hearts, even though it
seemed absolutely certain we could effect
nothing so far as the welfare of the Cause
was concerned.
</p>

<p>
It is not my purpose to write at any
length regarding the adventure which befell
us, for among the many deeds of daring
which the followers of General Marion
were given liberty to perform, this incident
would seem to one who did not take part
in it, as something too trifling to be worthy
of mention.
</p>

<p>
Therefore will I tell it hurriedly, and in
the fewest words, in order the sooner to
come to that time of sorrow and humiliation
when we began the retreat from the
lower Carolinas.
</p>

<p>
We, fifty picked men, and I speak of
Percy and myself as such although we
were only boys, set out near to noon on the
reconnoiter, understanding that the remainder
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_153' name='Page_153'>[153]</a></span>
of the force led by General Marion
would follow fifteen or twenty miles in the
rear in order to be ready, if opportunity
presented itself, to fall upon the detached
bands of Major Wemyss' command.
</p>

<p>
It was known, however, that the general
would halt at the old Sinclair plantation,
if it so chanced that the venture should
lead us thus far.
</p>

<p>
Until nightfall we rode straight on, and
then we were met by those who told us
that the advance guard of the enemy was
near at hand.
</p>

<p>
The command was immediately given
for each man to conceal himself in the
thicket either side the road, where a view
could be had of the enemy as they passed,
and in such position we were to remain
until the last straggler was beyond us,
after which the major proposed that, by
making a wide detour, we could reach the
Sinclair plantation in ample time to give
an alarm, should it be learned that the
attack was not advisable.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_154' name='Page_154'>[154]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Although we were in hiding, and there
was little reason for whosoever might lead
this force to believe any of Marion's men
were in the vicinity, the position we had
taken was a dangerous one, for peradventure
one of our horses was allowed to
whinny, the Britishers would attack immediately,
when fifty against a thousand
would stand small chance of escape.
</p>

<p>
It was nightfall before the first of the
red-coated column appeared, and Percy and
I, standing side by side, gripping our
horses' muzzles, saw the formidable 63d
Regulars as they came up with swinging
stride even more than a thousand strong,
and marched by our place of concealment
with never a thought that the very prey
for whom they were seeking might be
near at hand.
</p>

<p>
My heart literally stood still for the time
being, because even a lad unused to warfare
knew beyond a question that should
these men learn where we were hidden
the end would come speedily.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_155' name='Page_155'>[155]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
I hardly dared to breathe, lest by so doing
an alarm be given, and yet although
fifty horses were concealed either side the
road, not a sound was heard to betoken
their whereabouts.
</p>

<p>
The regiment marched by; then came
the Tory command under Major Harrison,
which I believe was even more in numbers
than Major Wemyss' men, and after them,
more than a thousand yards in the rear,
twenty Tory stragglers.
</p>

<p>
The major, my uncle, was stationed on
the opposite side of the road from where
Percy and I stood, and we had no knowledge
whatsoever of his movements.
</p>

<p>
When these rascally traitors to their
country lounged along, evidently believing
themselves safe because of the large
force in advance, the thought came into
my mind that it would be a proper ending
to our reconnoissance if we set upon
them suddenly.
</p>

<p>
This idea had no more than come into
my mind when we heard a crashing noise
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_156' name='Page_156'>[156]</a></span>
from the opposite side of the road, and
immediately the major appeared, followed
by all who had remained with him, and
we needed no other signal.
</p>

<p>
In a twinkling, as it were, the Tory
stragglers were surrounded, and perhaps no
more than sixty seconds elapsed before
each man of them had been disarmed
and was mounted behind one of our troop.
</p>

<p>
Then it can readily be understood that
we put spurs to our horses, striking through
the wooded country to the left in order to
circle around the main body of the enemy,
and the frightened prisoners had an opportunity
of knowing that we raised good
stock in Williamsburg district, for in less
than an hour we were come to the Sinclair
plantation.
</p>

<p>
The information for which we had sent
was gained, and, in addition, we had twenty
disconsolate-looking prisoners, who by this
time had come to know that the Cause of
freedom in the Carolinas was not yet wholly
crushed out.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_157' name='Page_157'>[157]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
The renegades were herded into a stable,
and, to the surprise of us all, no order was
given to dismount.
</p>

<p>
That portion of the force which had been
left behind with General Marion was in the
saddle when we came up, and there they
remained, as did we, while our officers,
withdrawing to a clump of live oaks near
at hand, entered into what proved to be a
long, and certainly was a serious, consultation.
</p>

<p>
We knew full well that our future movements
were being decided upon, and although
there were more than two thousand
armed men in the immediate vicinity
searching for us, who would soon be joined
by Tarleton's Legion, I believe there was
not one of our brigade who did not hope
most certainly that we would be pitted
against them, desperate though the odds
were.
</p>

<p>
Not until an hour before sunrise was the
consultation come to an end, and then came
the long expected order to advance.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_158' name='Page_158'>[158]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"Ay; but in what direction?" Gavin
Witherspoon, who was by my side, asked
in a low tone, and the answer came later,
when General Marion said:
</p>

<p>
"My men, it is the opinion of all in command
that we return to Lynch's Creek, and
I ask you to have confidence in us who have
arrived at this decision, which is as painful
to those who made it as to those who hear
it. Nothing can be accomplished by staying
here where capture or death must inevitably
result; but so long as we remain
at liberty, so long will the Cause live, and
I promise you that however unpleasant and
apparently disastrous may seem this move,
you shall yet have many opportunities of
striking at the British uniform. I ask
that you follow, as you have done since I
came among you, cheerfully and without
question, believing that this step has not
been decided upon without due deliberation."
</p>

<p>
"We are on the retreat," Gavin Witherspoon
said to me as the general ceased
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_159' name='Page_159'>[159]</a></span>
speaking, and the words were no more than
uttered before a groan was heard throughout
the entire line.
</p>

<p>
I here set it down, repeating the words
that these brave fellows, only an hundred
and fifty strong, could not repress their
sorrow because at this moment, when we
were threatened by over two thousand
armed men, one-half of them well-trained
troops, the word had been given to fall back.
</p>

<p>
It is proof of the spirit of patriotism
which animated the hearts of those in
Williamsburg district, that they were saddened
only because of not being brought
immediately face to face with an enemy
which could conquer them by sheer force
of numbers.
</p>

<p>
If the cause of liberty was crushed out
elsewhere, it yet lived and burned with an
ardent flame in the hearts of those who
had pledged themselves to follow General
Marion, and among these patriots Percy
Sumter and myself had the good fortune
to be numbered.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_160' name='Page_160'>[160]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Well, we set out on what can be called
none other than a retreat, for once we left
the enemy behind us there was no other
name for the move. The old camp at
Lynch's Creek was the direct road to North
Carolina, and the king's forces were hunting
for us in Williamsburg district.
</p>

<p>
Now let it be fully understood what all
that meant, and then in years to come no
man may wonder why we whose homes
were hereabout had sadness in our hearts.
</p>

<p>
For the first time since we had risen in
our might against the king's oppression,
were the people of Williamsburg and of
Pedee to be left unprotected. Until this
moment the enemy had never appeared
in our neighborhood with such a force as
enabled them to over-run it without fear
of opposition.
</p>

<p>
Once we were gone our people must suffer
the tender mercies of the Britishers
and the Tories who had in other parts of
the Carolinas, wherever they penetrated,
written their names in blood and in flame.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_161' name='Page_161'>[161]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Heretofore the James family, standing
at the head of those who served the Cause,
had kept this section of the Carolina colonies
free from the invader. Now they
were to leave it&mdash;to abandon it&mdash;while
there were yet two thousand enemies in
the district with more to come, and knowing
full well that should they ever return
again it would be to find their houses smoking
ruins, their wives and children homeless
and wandering. It was to leave behind
all that was dear, and all that was sacred
in order that the flame of freedom might,
although burning feebly, yet be unquenched.
</p>

<p>
Even if Percy and I were yet lads, we
were full grown in the knowledge of what
had been and what would come, therefore,
but in a lesser degree, of course, were we
bowed down by sorrow as, setting our
faces in that direction which would lead
us away from home, we allowed the steeds
to make their way at such pace as pleased
them.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_162' name='Page_162'>[162]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
No man set spur on that ride; no man
urged his horse forward, for it was as if we
were held back by chains, and little wonder.
</p>

<p>
At the time this seemed to us to be a
shameful march; but now I can look back
upon it and realize how necessary it was&mdash;can
understand that He who rules the
destinies of nations had willed that, like
the children of Israel, we should wander
through the desert a certain time before
we were come to the Promised Land.
</p>

<p>
Now having set down all that was in our
hearts at this time, let me hurry over such
portion of the story, for it is not pleasant
to dwell upon it.
</p>

<p>
We arrived at Lynch's Creek that evening,
and here we were halted only so long
as was necessary to make the arrangements
already decided upon between our leaders.
</p>

<p>
Those who had families were requested,
when we had come into the old camp, to
leave the brigade and return home, there
to remain until such time as they might
be again summoned.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_163' name='Page_163'>[163]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
This was done in order that we might
move more secretly, and also that those
who were needed at home should be enabled
to give to their loved ones at least the
last words which might be spoken on earth.
</p>

<p>
Within an hour our force was reduced to
sixty men, and yet there remained among
us every member of the James family&mdash;a
fact which went far toward cheering Percy
and I in this retreat.
</p>

<p>
Five were there, John, William, Gavin,
Robert and James, and each had a family;
yet none would desert the leader in whom
they had every confidence&mdash;none would desert
the Cause, although it was come so low.
Yet for the honor of those who dropped out,
it must be said that they were ready at the
first signal to rejoin the brigade.
</p>

<p>
Gavin Witherspoon had a wife and five
children, the youngest eight years old. To
him I said, when, man after man, raising
his hat in adieu, departed with an expression
on his face which told of the sadness
in his heart:
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_164' name='Page_164'>[164]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"It is for you to go also, Gavin. Such as
Percy and I can well be spared, even though
we leave behind a mother whom we love;
but she has kinsfolk who will comfort
her."
</p>

<p>
"My family are alone in the district,
Robert Sumter, and yet they will be comforted,
knowing that I am doing my duty
as a man."
</p>

<p>
"Yet every one should care for his own,
and you can well be spared when this
movement is no more than a retreat."
</p>

<p>
"Ay, so I may be," the old man replied
emphatically, and in such a tone as caused
me to grip him heartily by the hand. "So
I may be, and yet it would shame me to go,
because now has come the hour of our adversity&mdash;the
time when all hope seems to
have fled; but my desire to free the colonies
from the yoke of the king is as strong as
when I first set out, nigh on to four years
ago. I shall remain in the saddle, Robert
Sumter, until we have won that toward
which we set our faces, or a British bullet
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_165' name='Page_165'>[165]</a></span>
has brought me low, and in the doing find
happiness for myself as well as give comfort
to those who look upon me for an
example."
</p>

<p>
It was a brave man who spoke those
words, and I said then in my heart that
never again would I allow another to utter
aught against Gavin Witherspoon&mdash;never
again would I allow Percy or myself to
laugh at his oddities or his whimsical
fancies.
</p>

<p>
Freshly mounted were we who left
Lynch's Creek at sunset on the day when
we were arrived at the old camp, after those
who went insisted on bringing to us their
best horses and the major part of all their
store of ammunition, because, in so doing,
it seemed as if they were contributing in
some slight degree to sustaining the Cause
which they had long since despaired of
seeing successful.
</p>

<p>
Dark days indeed were these which had
come upon us; but they were needed, as
was afterwards proven, to strengthen our
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_166' name='Page_166'>[166]</a></span>
hearts for the future trial, which led us on
to victory when defeat was seemingly already
upon us.
</p>

<p>
From the hour of leaving Lynch's Creek
until we were arrived in North Carolina,
at Amy's Mill on Downing Creek, we never
drew rein, save to halt that the tired steeds
might find rest, and at this last encampment,
we remained four and twenty
hours.
</p>

<p>
From there a detachment of ten was
sent back as scouts to gain intelligence of
what might be going on in the lower Carolinas,
and to cheer those of our number
who had been left behind, in order that the
fire of patriotism might be kept burning.
</p>

<p>
Then once more we took up the line of
retreat, holding it until we were come to
the east side of White Marsh, near the
head of the Waccamaw River, where my
uncle, the major, told us three comrades
that a permanent camp would be established.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_167' name='Page_167'>[167]</a></span>
</p>

<h2>
CHAPTER VIII.<br />
<span class="s08">BLACK MINGO SWAMP.</span></h2>

<p>
A protracted halt to men whose hearts
are heavy is not a desirable boon, and so
we from Williamsburg soon discovered.
</p>

<p>
The first idea in our minds, when we
were come into camp and began to build
shelters for ourselves, each after his own
liking, was that we could enjoy this respite
from a roving life, where it was necessary
to be constantly on the alert against
danger.
</p>

<p>
Once we had really settled down, however,
and there was nothing of especial
moment with which to occupy our attention,
the hours moved so slowly as to seem
like unto days.
</p>

<p>
At first we three comrades spent a goodly
portion of the time speculating among ourselves
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_168' name='Page_168'>[168]</a></span>
as to how long we might be able to
hold the field against the numberless men
which the king was sending in pursuit;
but after a time we were wearied with such
occupation, and began to long for active
duty.
</p>

<p>
This isolation and sense of perfect security
grew irksome, and there was not a man
among the small detachment who would
not gladly have faced a foe of five times
our number, in order to shake off the lethargy
which began to creep over him after
eight and forty hours had passed.
</p>

<p>
On the fourth day after our having settled
down in this encampment, Major James
and Captain Mouzon were sent back into
the lower Carolinas to make certain those
who were enlisted in the Williamsburg
brigade held steadfast to their pledges, and
the absence of our uncle was to Percy and
I like a great calamity. We looked upon
him not only as the head of the family;
but as a true friend and companion-in-arms
upon whom we could rely under every circumstance,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_169' name='Page_169'>[169]</a></span>
and although not thrown much
in his company because of the position we
occupied in the force, the knowledge of his
being near at hand, did we need his advice,
was in itself a pleasurable satisfaction
which we failed fully to realize until he
was absent.
</p>

<p>
When a week passed and we were "rusting
out," as Gavin Witherspoon said, it
seemed absolutely necessary we have some
employment, and the old man said to me
one morning while Percy was making
ready the breakfast:
</p>

<p>
"Three men have already been sent out
as scouts since we came into this camp,
and such duty is necessary because it
stands to reason that the Tories will make
every effort to discover the general's hiding-place."
</p>

<p>
"Ay, all you have said is true, Gavin
Witherspoon," I replied; "but of what
avail is it to us since the general calls upon
others to act as scouts, forgetting that we
readily performed such duty when it was
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_170' name='Page_170'>[170]</a></span>
an hundred times more dangerous than
at present?"
</p>

<p>
"This is how it may avail," the old man
said in the tone of one who defies contradiction.
"You shall go this morning to
General Marion and offer the services of
us three, promising that we will act as
scouts so long as the detachment remains
here."
</p>

<p>
"But if he refuses to detail us for such
work?"
</p>

<p>
"Then pluck up sufficient courage to remind
him that we went gladly, when,
perchance, every man in the command
would have hesitated. By so doing you
may make him understand he owes something
to us three."
</p>

<p>
At first thought I was not willing to
browbeat our commander, for it appeared
to me that what Gavin Witherspoon had
proposed was little less than an attempt
to bully the general into acceding to our
desires; but the longer I considered the
matter the more reasonable did it seem
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_171' name='Page_171'>[171]</a></span>
that we should be sent out, rather than
forced to remain in camp where our presence
was of no possible benefit.
</p>

<p>
By going we should take away nothing
of value from the encampment, and it
might be possible fortune would so favor
us that we could render some signal assistance,
even though it did not seem probable
there was any force of the enemy in that
vicinity.
</p>

<p>
Therefore it was that I did as Gavin
Witherspoon requested, and to our great
surprise the general not only willingly
gave his consent, but said it pleasured him
much that we should so desire to serve the
Cause.
</p>

<p>
"While we remain here waiting such
turn in the tide of affairs as will give us
an opportunity to serve the colonists, it is
well to know thoroughly all the country
and its inhabitants," he said in conclusion.
"Therefore, so that you return to camp
and report once in every four and twenty
hours, you not only have my permission;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_172' name='Page_172'>[172]</a></span>
but will lay me under obligation by
acting the part of scouts, spies or whatsoever
you choose to call the officer."
</p>

<p>
It can well be understood that we did
not linger long after this interview.
</p>

<p>
In less than an hour we three, provided
with such store of provisions as would be
our portion until the following day, and
carrying an ample amount of ammunition,
set out with no idea whatsoever as to where
chance might lead us, save that it seemed
wisest to travel toward the south, for in
that direction lay home and friends.
</p>

<p>
Gavin Witherspoon at once took command
of the party by proceeding in advance,
and we, having good cause to trust
him implicitly, were more than willing to
follow as he should propose.
</p>

<p>
There was no thought in our minds that
a single enemy might be near at hand.
</p>

<p>
The only possibility counted upon was
that we should run across one or more
Tories seeking to find the encampment, and
thus, perchance, prevent discovery.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_173' name='Page_173'>[173]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Thus it was we proceeded with a certain
amount of caution, although not deeming
it necessary.
</p>

<p>
Until late in the afternoon we traveled
along the banks of the Waccamaw River,
our faces turned toward Williamsburg, and
then Percy said, as he threw himself at full
length by the side of the stream:
</p>

<p>
"We are come on a mission which cannot
bear fruit, and it makes little difference
whether we halt here, or five miles further
on. Having remained so long in camp
without exercise, my legs tire quickly, and
I propose to rest for the night."
</p>

<p>
We were ready to gratify him in this
respect, the more so because all of us were
in much the same condition, and therefore
it was that our scout came to an end, for
the time being, hardly more than fifteen
miles from the starting-point.
</p>

<p>
Surely we had no reason to grumble
against fortune on this our first visit in the
Upper Carolinas.
</p>

<p>
Such food as we had was ready cooked,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_174' name='Page_174'>[174]</a></span>
and in order to make camp it was only
necessary to lie down among the bushes,
where for a time all slept as we had not
done during the time of idleness.
</p>

<p>
The sun was within an hour of setting
when I awakened and found my companions
lying in restful attitudes, but with
open eyes.
</p>

<p>
They also had satisfied the desire for
slumber.
</p>

<p>
How it chanced that we three remained
there without speaking one to another, I
know not; but so we did, strangely enough,
and because of our unwitting silence were
we enabled to accomplish that which had
seemed improbable.
</p>

<p>
Human voices in the distance, but sounding
nearer and nearer, attracted our attention,
causing all three to rise and
seek better concealment, when we saw
through the foliage a party of seven
armed men coming up the bank of the
stream from the south, and proceeding with
a certain degree of caution which told that
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_175' name='Page_175'>[175]</a></span>
they were in search of something or some
one.
</p>

<p>
Although not absolutely certain, we felt
reasonably sure these travelers were enemies,
and well we might, considering the
fact that nowhere between here and the
Carolinas was it known that any friends of
the Cause had habitation.
</p>

<p>
When the party passed where we were
in hiding, they had ceased conversation;
therefore we had no means of determining
who they were, save that all wore portions
of a Britisher's accouterments, while our
friends still held to the powder-horn and
shot-pouch.
</p>

<p>
Not until they were lost to view in the
distance did either of us speak, and then
it was Percy who said, much as if he had
made an important discovery:
</p>

<p>
"They are Tories, and searching for
General Marion's encampment."
</p>

<p>
"I allow all that to be true, lad, and now
what may be our duty?" Gavin Witherspoon
asked.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_176' name='Page_176'>[176]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"To learn where they halt for the night,
and then carry the information back to
camp," my brother said heedlessly, for indeed
that seemed to be the only course left
for us.
</p>

<p>
"There is in my mind a better plan,
lad, and, if it so be you two are willing
to take the chances, I venture to
predict we will carry yonder gentlemen
before General Marion, instead of
hastening ahead to tell him they are
coming."
</p>

<p>
"Do you mean that we three are to attack
seven?" Percy asked, and the old
man said with a smile:
</p>

<p>
"I have seen both you lads ride gallantly
forward when it was a case of twenty
against one, and yet you hesitate with the
odds not much more than double against
us?"
</p>

<p>
"Percy does not hesitate," I replied,
jealous lest there should be a question as
to the courage of one of our family. "So
that it is in your mind, Gavin Witherspoon,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_177' name='Page_177'>[177]</a></span>
we will agree to anything that has the
faintest hope of success."
</p>

<p>
"This is my plan: Yonder strangers
are doubtless enemies; but if they prove to
be friends, then have we done them no
harm by carrying out that which is in my
mind. We will follow so far in the rear
that there is no danger of being discovered
until they camp for the night, and then it
will go hard indeed if we fail to find an
opportunity for making them prisoners."
</p>

<p>
I did not agree with Gavin Witherspoon
in his belief that we might readily make
prisoners of seven men; yet was I well
pleased to venture the attempt, believing
something of good might come, even
though we failed in the purpose. It was
seldom we who held true to the colonies
had an opportunity of striking even so
slight a blow as this when the odds were
no more than two against one, and it would
have been folly for us to have refused such
a chance.
</p>

<p>
Percy, once the plan was made plain, did
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_178' name='Page_178'>[178]</a></span>
not consider it necessary to say whether
he agreed to it or not.
</p>

<p>
To his mind, all who were acquainted
with him should know he would favor any
plan, and there was little need for Gavin
Witherspoon to go further into details than
he had already done.
</p>

<p>
"It is such work as this for which we
left the camp," Percy said quietly, "and
if the strangers are friends, we can atone
for any rough handling by showing them
the way to General Marion's camp."
</p>

<p>
This, so nearly as I can repeat it after
these many years, was all that passed between
us regarding the venture, and we set
off on the trail without further delay.
</p>

<p>
There is less difficulty in successfully
stalking a man than a deer, and this last
had both Percy and I performed time and
time again until it seemed to us like a
simple task. Therefore it was that Gavin
Witherspoon had no green hands to aid
him in the work he had cut out.
</p>

<p>
Keeping so far in the rear as to hear the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_179' name='Page_179'>[179]</a></span>
noise as they forced their way through the
underbrush, and yet not so near that we
might by any possibility be seen, the three
of us followed this little company who
might be friends, but were probably enemies,
until the going down of the sun, when
we knew from such sounds as came to us
that they had halted.
</p>

<p>
Now it was only a matter of waiting,
which, under almost any circumstances,
is the most difficult task to perform patiently;
yet every lad who has hunted wild
turkeys is well schooled in such work, and
it can safely be said that we did not risk a
failure by being over-eager.
</p>

<p>
The men, although having advanced
with but little caution, realized the fact that
there might be enemies in the vicinity, for
they forbore building a camp-fire, and this
fact rendered our work rather more difficult
than it otherwise would have been.
</p>

<p>
After it was certain they had settled
down for the night we stole nearer and
nearer, until it was possible to hear the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_180' name='Page_180'>[180]</a></span>
conversation carried on in an ordinary tone,
and then we remained motionless until the
time for action should arrive.
</p>

<p>
When we were come thus far I believed
we should hear such words as would declare
whether these seven men were friends or
enemies, and in this I was not disappointed,
although we failed to learn anything of
importance.
</p>

<p>
While eating supper one of them, in the
course of the ordinary conversation concerning
the tramp of the day, remarked:
</p>

<p>
"There is no probability we shall find
any of the rebels during the next two or
three days' march, for as yet we are among
those who remain loyal to the king."
</p>

<p>
The words as written above were all we
had to give us a clue to the character of
these strangers; but they were sufficient.
</p>

<p>
We knew now, as well as if these men
had explained at length, that they were
in search of General Marion's encampment,
and from that instant, answering for Percy
as well as Gavin Witherspoon, I know that
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_181' name='Page_181'>[181]</a></span>
the three of us counted on making a capture
at whatsoever hazard.
</p>

<p>
Not until fully an hour after the men
had stretched themselves upon the ground
and the last word was spoken between
them, did we make a move toward nearing
the encampment.
</p>

<p>
Then it was that I would have gone forward,
risking the danger with the belief
that my life had better be made the price,
rather than either of the others, when the
old man laid his hand on mine as he
whispered softly in my ear:
</p>

<p>
"It is for me to go, first, because I have
had more experience in such work, and
again, on the plea that I can best be spared
to the Cause if either of us must pay a
penalty for leading in the attack."
</p>

<p>
Although there may be the twang of a
braggart in the words, still must it be set
down that I tried to restrain Gavin Witherspoon,
but without success.
</p>

<p>
When I would have pushed him away
he held me back, and it seemed impossible
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_182' name='Page_182'>[182]</a></span>
to advance without such a squabble as
would have given the alarm.
</p>

<p>
I was absolutely forced to let him take
the lead; but Percy and I kept close upon
his heels.
</p>

<p>
When, after creeping so cautiously that
not a twig snapped beneath our weight, we
had come to the small cleared place on
the bank of the stream which the men
had selected as an encampment, we saw
that they were sleeping near the foot of a
pine tree that had been overturned by the
wind.
</p>

<p>
The overhanging mass of roots formed
a certain sort of shelter which served to
protect them from the dew.
</p>

<p>
Their rifles were stacked against one of
the branches at a distance of fully three
yards from where they lay, and, as a matter
of course, it was necessary to first secure
possession of these.
</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i196" id="i196"></a>
<img src="images/i-196.jpg" width="347" height="564" alt="" />
<p class="caption">As Gavin gathered up the weapons, Percy and I called upon the sleepers to
surrender.&mdash;<a href="#Page_183">Page 183</a>.
</p>
</div>

<p>
Gavin did his work, as we knew beyond
a question he could do, and when he raised
himself beside the weapons, we two, Percy
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_183' name='Page_183'>[183]</a></span>
and I, sprang to our feet, calling upon the
sleepers to surrender.
</p>

<p>
They had no other choice than to obey,
and sheepish indeed were these seven after
we had drawn them up in line, when they
understood how small was the force which
had taken them prisoners.
</p>

<p>
Yet were they reasonably good men, so
far as Tories go, inasmuch as no one spoke
a word, all refusing to answer the questions
which we asked.
</p>

<p>
So far as we ourselves were concerned
this made little difference, and without delay,
although they as well as ourselves were
fatigued, most likely, by the long tramp,
we began the return to General Marion's
camp.
</p>

<p>
As it proved later, our capture was of
great importance, even though the prisoners
stoutly refused to give information
when the general questioned them, for their
presence showed that Tarleton was hot
after us, knowing somewhat of our whereabouts,
and the time was come when we
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_184' name='Page_184'>[184]</a></span>
must retreat yet further, or return to the
task of showing the invaders that the
spirit of liberty in these southern colonies
was not yet crushed out.
</p>

<p>
Now let me set down here what we had
learned since the day when we set free
the one hundred and fifty Continentals
who refused, save in the case of the three
true men, to join our force.
</p>

<p>
Major Wemyss had marched for seventy
miles from Nelson's Ferry, straight across
the district of Williamsburg, desolating
a path fifteen miles in breadth after such
merciless fashion that one would have
said he had been taught in the schools of
the savage.
</p>

<p>
All the dwellings on his way, save those
habited by well-known Tories, were given
to the flames; the people were plundered
of their possessions; such property as the
troops could not use was destroyed, while
the animals were wantonly shot and allowed
to rot where they fell.
</p>

<p>
Those who were thus plundered saw all
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_185' name='Page_185'>[185]</a></span>
their belongings swept away by fire, and
they, even to the women and children, were
held forcibly back to prevent them from
saving the smallest article of value.
</p>

<p>
Men were hanged without semblance of
trial, and when their loved ones pleaded
for mercy, the British soldiery rode them
down.
</p>

<p>
All the time it seemed almost as if the
good God had forsaken the colonies, and yet
we came to know that all these acts of
barbarous cruelty were necessary to arouse
our people from the fear and the despondency
into which they had fallen.
</p>

<p>
It did arouse them.
</p>

<p>
It forced men into the ranks of the
patriots who otherwise would have waited
quietly by until the colonies or the king
should have proven a right to the
country.
</p>

<p>
Within two days from the time the seven
scouts were taken prisoners and we had
arrived at our encampment, the hour was
come when we should return, and among
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_186' name='Page_186'>[186]</a></span>
those on the banks of the Waccamaw who
held steadfast to General Marion, there
was no one who did not rejoice because the
moment for action was at hand.
</p>

<p>
Taking the prisoners with us, we set out
on a forced march, which was continued
night and day until we had seen the sun
rise and set three times while we yet remained
in the saddle, save when it was
absolutely necessary to give rest to our
steeds.
</p>

<p>
Then we were come to Lynch's Creek
once more&mdash;to the old camp&mdash;where we
found all those who had waited behind
until the signal should be given, with the
addition of more than two hundred new
recruits&mdash;men who had been driven by the
cruelty of the king's hirelings into the
ranks of those who would save their
country.
</p>

<p>
More than this, those whom we met
gave information that Major Wemyss had
retired to Georgetown, wearied with chasing
the Swamp Fox, and a body of six
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_187' name='Page_187'>[187]</a></span>
hundred well-armed Tories were encamped
near Black Mingo Swamp, fifteen miles below
where we were halted, under command
of Captain John Ball.
</p>

<p>
Here was our work cut out for us, and
like the true patriot and ardent soldier
that he was, General Marion gave us no
cause to complain of hesitation on his part.
</p>

<p>
It was less than four hours from the
time our command was halted, and while
yet we were exchanging greetings with
those who had parted from us so many
days before, that our commander, calling
the men in a body around him, thus
spoke:
</p>

<p>
"Hardly more than two hours' ride from
here are encamped a force of these renegades
whom we call Tories. They outnumber
us slightly; but even though
there were twice as many, yet I believe
you who have served so gallantly under
me since I came into the Williamsburg
district, could whip them in the open field.
We are told that recruits are flocking from
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_188' name='Page_188'>[188]</a></span>
every quarter of this portion of the colony
to join us, and by waiting we may double
our strength; yet at the same time it is
possible that the enemy will take the alarm
and flee. I propose that we march at once,
and within twenty-four hours from the
time of returning to the scene of our
labors strike such a blow as shall give
Tarleton and Wemyss to understand that
the spirit of liberty has been revived,
rather than broken, by their butcheries
and their barbarities."
</p>

<p>
A ringing cheer, in which every man
participated, was the answer to this speech,
and more than that no commander could
need.
</p>

<p>
Five minutes later, it could not have been
more, we were in the saddle, led by two
sons of Captain Waties, who had already
made themselves familiar with the approaches
to the enemy's camp, and Major
James, my uncle, said as he reined his horse
in that he might fall back between Percy
and I for a moment:
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_189' name='Page_189'>[189]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"Lads, we have once more taken up the
work, and with such a commander I venture
to predict that it will not cease, until
the last adherent to the Cause has yielded up
his life, or we have brought the Carolinas
out from under the sway of the butchers."
</p>

<p>
Gavin Witherspoon, who had been riding
slightly in the rear, spurred his horse forward
until he could speak with my uncle:
</p>

<p>
"Whereabout in the Black Mingo are
these scurvy scoundrels encamped?"
</p>

<p>
"At Shepherd's Ferry on the south side
of the stream."
</p>

<p>
"Then we must cross that bridge on
planks, if I mistake not, in order to come
at them?"
</p>

<p>
"You are right, Gavin."
</p>

<p>
"And so many horsemen as we number
may not be able to do that without giving
an alarm."
</p>

<p>
"It is a chance which we must take.
Whether they have warning of our approach,
or not, from the moment we reach
the causeway our advance must be rapid."
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_190' name='Page_190'>[190]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Then my uncle rode ahead to join General
Marion, and we, tired and sleepy from
being long in the saddle without proper
hours of rest, relapsed into silence until we
were arrived at this same bridge of which
Gavin had spoken.
</p>

<p>
It was midnight, and I had said to Percy
that all the odds were in our favor, so far
as taking the enemy by surprise was concerned,
when the foremost of the troops
clattered across the planks.
</p>

<p>
Within sixty seconds an alarm gun was
heard from the Tory encampment.
</p>

<p>
Now was come the time, and the first,
when we two lads were to take part in a conflict
where the enemy was expecting us.
</p>

<p>
It would be a real battle, and Percy cried,
clasping my hand as we spurred our horses
on at a gallop lest we be left in the rear:
</p>

<p>
"We may perchance come to our death,
Bob, before the sun shall rise again; but
it shall never be said that we failed to follow
the head of the family wherever he
might lead!"
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_191' name='Page_191'>[191]</a></span>
</p>

<h2>
CHAPTER IX.<br />
<span class="s08">THE BATTLE.</span></h2>

<p>
Of the battle, short, sharp and bloody,
which followed after we had given the
alarm by riding across the plank causeway
into Black Mingo Swamp, I can set down
but little of my own knowledge, because
Gavin Witherspoon, Percy and myself were
with what was called, for the time being,
the "cavalry," and we saw only that portion
of the engagement which fell to our
share.
</p>

<p>
However, I have heard my uncle tell the
story again and again in these words, and
there can be no doubt as to its correctness,
however the historian of the future may
write concerning the action:
</p>

<p>
"After the alarm gun sounded, promptness
and swift riding became as necessary
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_192' name='Page_192'>[192]</a></span>
as had caution, and the general ordered
his men to follow him at a gallop until the
force reached the main road, about three
hundred yards from where it was known
the enemy lay.
</p>

<p>
"Here, with the exception of a small
number who were to act as cavalry, the
entire command dismounted. A body of
picked men under Captain Waties was ordered
down the road to attack Dollard's
house where the Tories had been posted.
Two companies under Hugh Horry were
sent to the right, and the cavalry to the
left, to support the attack, Marion himself
bringing up the rear.
</p>

<p>
"It so happened, however, that the Tories
had left the house immediately after being
alarmed, and were strongly drawn up in a
field near at hand.
</p>

<p>
"Here it was they encountered Horry's
command on the advance, with a fire equally
severe and unexpected. The effect was
that of a surprise upon the colonists.
Horry's troops fell back in confusion, but
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_193' name='Page_193'>[193]</a></span>
were promptly rallied and brought on the
charge.
</p>

<p>
"Immediately the battle became obstinate
and bloody; but the appearance of the
men under Waties, who came up suddenly
in the rear of the Tories, soon brought it to
a close. Finding themselves between two
fires, the enemy gave way in all directions
to flee for refuge to the neighboring swamp
of Black Mingo."
</p>

<p>
This is the story of the battle as I have
heard my uncle tell it many times.
</p>

<p>
As for the part which we three comrades
played, I can say but little in detail.
</p>

<p>
When the advance was ordered we rode
forward eagerly, for inaction had whetted
our desire, and once more we gave the renegade
sons of the colony a much needed
lesson.
</p>

<p>
To me the engagement was not as desperate
as either of the others in which Percy
and I had taken part, for at no time did
we of the cavalry come to a hand-to-hand
encounter with those who chose to serve a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_194' name='Page_194'>[194]</a></span>
king whose only delight was in oppression;
but that it was a real and a bloody battle
was known full well after we had gained
possession of the field, for then our officers
learned from such prisoners as had been
taken, that the enemy outnumbered us two
to one, and of all those engaged, true colonists
as well as false, a full third were
killed or disabled.
</p>

<p>
Our loss was great, when one takes into
consideration the fact that we made the
attack, and that it was in a certain sense
surprising.
</p>

<p>
Captain Logan was killed; Captain
Mouzon and Lieutenant Scott so severely
wounded that even though their lives
were saved it would be impossible for them
to do active service again, and more than
an hundred people were dead or disabled.
</p>

<p>
Among the Tories the execution had
been great; Captain Ball was dead, and a
full two hundred lay on the ground lifeless,
or wounded to such an extent that retreat
was impossible.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_195' name='Page_195'>[195]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
In addition to that, we had among us
one hundred and two as prisoners, and
they who had a few hours previous believed
the Cause of freedom in the Carolinas
was dead, now pleaded eagerly to be
allowed to enlist.
</p>

<p>
They had no love for country; but were
ready as ever to join such force as appeared
to be gaining ascendancy, and this
one victory had put the Cause on a different
footing from what it had been since
the day we made the attack upon the
Prince of Wales' regiment at Nelson's
Ferry.
</p>

<p>
In discussing this engagement afterward,
Gavin, Percy and I have decided, to our
own satisfaction at least, that not one
among our leaders had any idea of the
good which might result from what was
little less than a chance encounter when
the king's officers believed we had been
whipped into submission.
</p>

<p>
We ourselves almost became weary of
it as the days passed and this man or that,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_196' name='Page_196'>[196]</a></span>
who had previously declared his allegiance
to the king, came into camp, begging the
privilege to enlist under the banner of
General Marion.
</p>

<p>
But I am getting ahead of my story,
and it is little wonder, for on the night before
the battle at the Black Mingo we had
considered ourselves outlaws, whose only
hope lay in striking one or more severe
blows before death should befall us. Then
to find that the Cause had suddenly received
a new lease of life was so unexpected
and happily surprising, that even
at this late day I cannot forbear a sense
of triumph such as I did not know even
on the day peace was declared, when these
colonies had become a free nation&mdash;a nation
such as I doubt not will one day be a
power in the world.
</p>

<p>
We laid in this captured camp sufficiently
long to give all our friends opportunity
of joining us, and the faint-hearted
inhabitants nearabout time to declare
their pretended love for the Cause, before
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_197' name='Page_197'>[197]</a></span>
attempting to continue the lesson to the
red-coats which had been so long delayed.
</p>

<p>
It was during this time of inaction that
we were joined by a young man hardly
older than myself, who was destined to
make the fourth in our comradeship.
</p>

<p>
This was none other than Gabriel Marion,
the general's nephew, a lad loved by our
commander as if he had been a son, and
on whom one might pin his faith, knowing
full well it would never be betrayed.
</p>

<p>
This Gabriel did not resemble his uncle
in feature, else might we never have come
to take him to our hearts as we did. The
general wore a somber countenance, while
the lad was ever smiling, however great
the danger which threatened.
</p>

<p>
The general rarely spoke in a jovial
tone, while Gabriel never lost an opportunity
of uttering a jest.
</p>

<p>
Within half an hour after he rode into
the captured camp at Shepherd's Ferry
the general sent for Percy and myself,
and, when we presented ourselves, introduced
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_198' name='Page_198'>[198]</a></span>
his nephew much in the following
fashion:
</p>

<p>
"This lad is as dear to me as a son, and
his honor, his courage and patriotism as
near to my heart as my own, therefore do
I present him to you two lads whom I
know to be true and faithful to whatsoever
you set your word. Make of him a comrade,
and you will please me; hold him to
his duties as you hold each other, and you
will benefit him."
</p>

<p>
No words could have been more flattering
or more pleasing to us, and it can well
be imagined that we were especially careful
from this day out to merit the continuance
of the same favorable opinion.
</p>

<p>
Gabriel was a lad whom all would love
immediately after knowing him, and once
having formed his acquaintance, he was
found to be the same one day as another,&mdash;a
true, lovable comrade.
</p>

<p>
To him, as a matter of course, we told
all that had come to us, since we were regularly
enrolled as members of his uncle's
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_199' name='Page_199'>[199]</a></span>
force, and in so doing spoke necessarily of
Sam Lee.
</p>

<p>
Although we held ourselves ever ready to
meet any enemies of the Cause, it was that
young Tory whom we especially hoped to
come across.
</p>

<p>
If I have not heretofore set it down
strongly, let it be understood we had never
come to a new neighborhood without a
strong hope that he might be met, and
the three of us were resolved to capture
him at the first opportunity whatever the
hazard, for in all the Carolinas could be
found no more bitter enemy than this
same lad who had taken sides with the
hirelings of the king simply because of his
own vicious nature.
</p>

<p>
"Without good reason therefore, Sam Lee
is, I believe, bent on doing all possible
harm to us of Williamsburg, and when we
have made him prisoner, holding the
scoundrel so close that he cannot escape
until the Cause be won or hopelessly lost,
we shall have accomplished a good work,"
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_200' name='Page_200'>[200]</a></span>
Percy said when I had finished the story
regarding that young Tory.
</p>

<p>
"How may he, a lad without influence,
do so much mischief?" Gabriel
asked, and Gavin Witherspoon replied
promptly:
</p>

<p>
"It is because of being a mere boy that
gives him the advantage. Unless our
friends know him for what he is, it would
naturally be thought that he was incapable
of harm. I had rather have him in
my clutches than any man short of a
major in the British service."
</p>

<p>
"What prevents our setting out some
day and bringing him into camp?"
Gabriel asked with a merry laugh; but
there was no need I should answer the
question, for he knew full well had it been
possible we would have had the Tory within
our grasp long before this.
</p>

<p>
Just how many days we remained in
camp at Shepherd's Ferry I am unable to
set down, because there was much to occupy
our time, although such occupation
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_201' name='Page_201'>[201]</a></span>
was not directly connected with the
Cause.
</p>

<p>
We four comrades were constantly being
sent out as scouts, or to urge that the
planters near at hand bring in food, so
that one day went by after another with
exceeding swiftness and so much of pleasurable
intercourse that it was more like a
merry-making than a struggle against a
mighty king.
</p>

<p>
However, the day came when word was
whispered round about the camp that we
were to set out at once for Lynch's Creek,
to make an attack upon Colonel Harrison
and his Tory Legion.
</p>

<p>
While we were preparing for the journey,
good friends came in with tidings that
the renegades were gathering in large
force in and about Salem and the fork of
Black River.
</p>

<p>
Here it was, so we were told, that
Colonel Tynes of the British service had
appeared, summoning the people as good
subjects of his majesty to take the field
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_202' name='Page_202'>[202]</a></span>
against their countrymen, and he brought
with him ample supplies of war materials,
provisions, and even of luxuries such as
our people had not seen for many a month.
</p>

<p>
Eager though we were to be at Harrison's
Tories, the tidings of new muskets with
bayonets, broad swords, pistols, saddles,
bridles, and of powder and ball which the
Britisher had brought with him caused
our mouths to water.
</p>

<p>
Had General Marion neglected to take
advantage of such opportunity as seemed
suddenly to have presented itself, I believe
the men of his brigade, obedient and
faithful as they had been, would have
burst into loud murmurings, for we were
sadly in need of equipments.
</p>

<p>
Before the day on which this information
was brought had come to an end,
others who were friendly to the Cause
arrived with the definite information that
Colonel Tynes was encamped at Tarcote, on
the forks of Black River, and apparently
so secure in mind regarding his position
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_203' name='Page_203'>[203]</a></span>
that such watchfulness as common prudence
would have dictated was neglected.
</p>

<p>
It was just such an advantage as General
Marion delighted in; exactly the kind of
work for which we of the brigade were best
adapted, and every man was in a fever to
be at the task which was at one and the
same time for the benefit of the Cause and
the better equipment of ourselves.
</p>

<p>
While the officers deliberated, the rank
and file announced what articles they most
needed, as if it were only necessary to make
the statement in order to have their desires
fulfilled, and, in short, there was not one
among us but that believed we could have
for the choosing anything in Colonel Tynes'
stores.
</p>

<p>
Tarleton with his Legion was hot after
us, and so every one knew; but thus far we
had failed to meet him, and between his
force and ours was that gallant general of
Carolina, my father's kinsman, General
Sumter standing ever ready to interpose lest
Tarleton should fall upon General Marion
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_204' name='Page_204'>[204]</a></span>
when he was least prepared, and who
delighted in leading that British butcher
on a wild-goose chase.
</p>

<p>
Truly we two, Percy and I, had reason to
be proud of the men to whom we were
bound by ties of blood, for the names of
Sumter and James stood high, and with
good cause, among the defenders of the
Carolinas in those dark days when armed
resistance seemed little short of suicide.
</p>

<p>
I realize that this task which Percy has
insisted I shall perform is being done in a
halting fashion, because of my speaking
overly much, perhaps, of those who
remained true during the darkest days
known by the southern colonies; but yet
how may it be possible to tell any portion of
the story of the Carolinas without mentioning
again and again the names of those
patriots who ventured life and fortune
when such sacrifice seemed hopeless?
</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i220" id="i220"></a>
<img src="images/i-220.jpg" width="342" height="550" alt="" />
<p class="caption">In the darkness we four comrades were sent forward to reconnoitre.&mdash;<a href="#Page_205">Page 205</a>.
</p>
</div>

<p>
However, just now must be told what
we of the Williamsburg district did with
the overly confident Colonel Tynes, and yet
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_205' name='Page_205'>[205]</a></span>
the story must be brief, because the adventure
was no more than an ordinary occurrence,
where neither glory nor honor is to
be won, nor great deeds accomplished.
</p>

<p>
At midnight, eight and forty hours after
the news had been brought, General Marion's
brigade descended upon Colonel
Tynes' camp, and simply overran it.
</p>

<p>
It seems strange even now that we
should have seized upon all that store,
throwing so many well-armed men into a
panic by simply riding among them, yet
such is the fact.
</p>

<p>
When, in the darkness of the night, the
brigade came upon the encampment, we
four comrades were sent forward to reconnoiter,
and true it is that we failed to find
a single sentinel on guard. In some of
the camps men were playing cards, in
others they slept, and yet more sat around
the camp-fires, drinking and smoking.
</p>

<p>
The officers were making merry in a
building hard by, and there were none to
oppose our progress.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_206' name='Page_206'>[206]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
The reconnaissance was attended with
as little danger as if we four had gone out
sight-seeing among friends, and when we
returned to where General Marion and my
uncle the major, awaited our coming, it
was with a story so incredible that for an
instant they could hardly believe our
statements.
</p>

<p>
Then the word "Forward" was given,
and we, as I have said, overran that camp
without hindrance.
</p>

<p>
Neither Britisher nor Tory so much as
discharged a gun; the redcoat and renegade
Carolinian alike sought refuge in flight,
hoping to gain the fastness of Tarcote
Swamp, and to have cut them down in
their panic would have been like murdering
men in cold blood, for how can you
take the life of him who offers no resistance?
</p>

<p>
Twenty minutes had not elapsed from
the time we made our report, until the encampment
with all its wealth of British
stores was our own, and here and there
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_207' name='Page_207'>[207]</a></span>
came some scurvy Tory crawling and
cringing before our officers as he begged
to be allowed the privilege of enlisting.
</p>

<p>
It was not warfare; but simply a foraging
expedition among people who were the
same as unarmed.
</p>

<p>
Colonel Tynes, two of his captains, and
fifty-four British regulars were taken
prisoners. We hardly troubled ourselves
about the Tories, save that Gavin, Percy,
Gabriel and I rode here and there searching
eagerly for Sam Lee, but finding him not.
</p>

<p>
When day broke our men overhauled
the equipments and the provisions which
were intended for those who should take
up arms against us, and before we gave
heed to breaking our fast the old and
patched saddles were replaced by new ones
of English make; our powder-horns and
shot-pouches were filled; we wore breeches
and boots that had been brought for the
benefit of our enemies, and, to a man, were
as well equipped as any force the butcher
Tarleton ever headed.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_208' name='Page_208'>[208]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
The prisoners were sent to Kingstree,
which town we now believed ourselves
capable of holding, and in the fourth encampment
that had been wrested from the
Britishers or their allies, we feasted and
made merry, Gabriel declaring that he
was "disappointed in having thus joined
a band of foragers when he expected to
see somewhat of warfare."
</p>

<p>
And the poor lad did see warfare in
its most bitter phase before many days
passed.
</p>

<p>
Now that I am come to the closing acts
in this life which we knew for so short a
time and loved so well, I must hasten over
them because of the bitterness which
comes to me with the memory that has
never faded.
</p>

<p>
We three comrades&mdash;meaning Gavin,
Percy and myself&mdash;had seen the darkest
days of the struggle, and then suddenly
participated in the joy which came to us
when, seemingly without good reason, we
were once more triumphant.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_209' name='Page_209'>[209]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Gabriel had come at the moment when
we were flushed with the excitement of
unexpected success, and he saw but little
of it, poor lad!
</p>

<p>
While we lay at Salem receiving every
day new recruits from those who had been
lukewarm to the Cause, and from the
cowards who believed safety lay only in
friendship with the "rebels," word was
brought that Lord Cornwallis had begged
Colonel Tarleton to "get at" General Marion.
</p>

<p>
It was said that the butcher had arisen
from a bed of sickness brought about by
his own excesses, with a vow that he
would capture "the scurvy Swamp Fox,"
and that his Legion, which was before
Camden, had orders to meet him on the
Wateree River, from which place he
would set out to make a prisoner of our
general.
</p>

<p>
This information came to us at a time
when we were not only ready, but willing,
to meet the infamous Tarleton, although
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_210' name='Page_210'>[210]</a></span>
in his Legion were two men, where there
was one of ours, and, as my uncle said with
a grim smile, when speaking to Gavin
Witherspoon after orders had been given
us to prepare for the march, "we would
make Colonel Tarleton's mission as easy
of accomplishment as was possible, so far
as showing him the whereabouts of the
Swamp Fox was concerned."
</p>

<p>
Our horses were in good condition;
every man among us eager to measure
strength with this human brute who had
devastated the Carolinas wherever he
marched, and we hardly drew rein until
arriving once more at Nelson's Ferry, on
the Santee River.
</p>

<p>
This was the second time we had crossed
the entire district of Williamsburg with
a swiftness such as astounded the British
horsemen, and it is little wonder that our
general received from them the name in
which we of his brigade gloried.
</p>

<p>
Exactly how strong the Britishers were
there was no means of knowing, although
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_211' name='Page_211'>[211]</a></span>
one might guess that Tarleton would not
come out with less than his full legion,
which numbered upwards of eleven hundred
men; but yet we pressed forward even
after having come upon their trail, and
knowing how much greater their force
was than ours&mdash;pressed forward close upon
their heels until the hour came when
it would have been folly to continue on,
because the horses were winded.
</p>

<p>
Then we made camp in the woods,
Gabriel Marion complaining bitterly because
his uncle had called a halt, although
the steed the lad bestrode could not have
advanced five miles more at an ordinary
pace.
</p>

<p>
Near the enemy, as we knew ourselves
to be, it was necessary to take every precaution
at this encampment, and we were
yet hard at work while our steeds were
feeding, throwing up such rude shelters as
would suffice for the use of the sharp-shooters,
when Colonel Richardson, who
served under General Sumter until
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_212' name='Page_212'>[212]</a></span>
wounded and had then retired to his plantation
for a time, came into camp.
</p>

<p>
Percy and I were acting as sentinels
when he first arrived, and, fearing some
treachery, for he was a stranger to us,
would have prevented him from even
speaking with one of our officers, had he
not referred to his services under our
father's brother with such minuteness of
detail that we could not longer remain incredulous.
</p>

<p>
I conducted him to where General Marion
and Major James sat upon the ground
amid a clump of bushes discussing plans for
the next day's work, and had hardly more
than saluted when a great light flashed
up on the western sky.
</p>

<p>
"It is the flames of my dwelling," Colonel
Richardson exclaimed bitterly, even before
the general and the major had time to
welcome him. "Tarleton's Legion is within
five miles, bent now as ever upon their
work of devastation!"
</p>

<p>
"And you have fled at such a time?"
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_213' name='Page_213'>[213]</a></span>
my uncle, the major, said, in a tone very
nearly that of reproach.
</p>

<p>
"I would willingly have given up my
life in defense of those whom I love; but
that you are in the greatest danger. Hidden
with my wife and children in one of
the outbuildings&mdash;no other able-bodied
man on the plantation to aid me in a
defense which would have been vain&mdash;I
saw a lad, whom I believe to be one of
the Tory Lees from nearabout Kingstree,
ride up and demand audience of Tarleton.
So near was the butcher to me at the
moment that I heard plainly the young
scoundrel's speech, and it was to the effect
that General Marion with his brigade lay
here at this place. There was no longer
any course left me save to give you warning,
for as soon as my plantation has been
ruined and the butcher satisfies himself I
am not at hand to be hanged, he will make
a descent upon you."
</p>

<p>
"We have come to give him that opportunity,"
my uncle, the major, said proudly,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_214' name='Page_214'>[214]</a></span>
whereat Colonel Richardson showed signs
of great alarm.
</p>

<p>
"You can easily be surrounded here,
and, with a force such as Tarleton has,
must be cut to pieces, however bravely
your men may fight. To make a stand
would be useless sacrifice of life, and I conjure
you, General Marion, that you seek a
more advantageous place in which to meet
the enemy; but whatsoever may be your
decision, I here offer myself as a recruit
until you shall have given the British cutthroat
a proper lesson."
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_215' name='Page_215'>[215]</a></span>
</p>

<h2>
CHAPTER X.<br />
<span class="s08">GEORGETOWN.</span></h2>

<p>
The information which Colonel Richardson
brought regarding the renegade who
had acquainted Tarleton with General
Marion's whereabouts, fired us four comrades
to such a degree that right willingly
would we have pushed forward alone in
the hope of taking him prisoner, even
while surrounded by his British friends.
</p>

<p>
As has already been set down, we gave
Sam Lee credit for doing whatsoever was
in his power against us, but, while it was
no surprise that he should have continued
making every effort to work harm to the
friends of freedom, there was mingled with
our righteous anger something of astonishment
at his success.
</p>

<p>
He might have lived twice the ordinary
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_216' name='Page_216'>[216]</a></span>
lifetime of a man without being able to do
as much mischief as in this case, when
our people were making ready to fall suddenly
upon Tarleton's forces.
</p>

<p>
Now, however, that was impossible.
Even Major James realized that, instead
of pushing on, we must beat a retreat
once more, and without loss of time.
</p>

<p>
From this moment until that sad hour
when Gavin, Percy and myself, to say
nothing of the general, were so sorely
afflicted, there is nothing of particular
moment to write, except that I set down
the different movements made by our
brigade, and the situation of affairs in the
Carolinas.
</p>

<p>
In less than twenty minutes from the
time Colonel Richardson came into the
encampment, were we urging our jaded
steeds through that gloomy swamp known
as the "wood-yard," and two hours later
the command was halted on Jack's Creek.
</p>

<p>
We had covered only six miles in all that
time, owing to the condition of the horses;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_217' name='Page_217'>[217]</a></span>
but it was sufficient, so far as eluding the
Britishers was concerned, because they
might not find us unless, perchance, more
spies were lurking around, until after the
day should break.
</p>

<p>
While Colonel Tarleton was a butcher&mdash;a
man who had no idea of mercy or compassion,
it is only just to give him the
credit of being a good soldier after his own
particular fashion.
</p>

<p>
As a man to lead rough-riders, he was
perhaps the best in the king's service, and
we who were fleeing before him understood
that not a single moment would be lost in
the pursuit. Ride as fast and as constantly
as we might, his men would be ever on
our heels, so long as they could hold the
pace, and it was endurance and the speed
of the horses which should give the final
result.
</p>

<p>
At daybreak our brigade was on the
march once more, making its way over
bogs and through swamps until it was arrived
at Benbow's Ferry, about ten miles
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_218' name='Page_218'>[218]</a></span>
above Kingstree, where was a strong natural
camp.
</p>

<p>
It was a place with which we were all
familiar. It commanded a passage of the
river, and was within easy riding distance
of all the country roundabout from which
we must draw provisions and provender.
As a rallying point it could not have been
equalled in the Carolinas, and should we
be hard pressed there were three difficult
passes through the swamp in the rear
where, if necessary, we might make a stubborn
fight.
</p>

<p>
Strong as was this position, General Marion
set about strengthening it yet further.
</p>

<p>
Trees were felled, breastworks put up,
and in eight and forty hours we were prepared
to meet Tarleton's much-vaunted
legion, reasoning that our defenses made
up for lack of numbers until we were fully
the enemy's equal.
</p>

<p>
Now we believed that a decisive battle
would soon be fought&mdash;one in which the
victory could not be doubtful, but where
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_219' name='Page_219'>[219]</a></span>
the conquerors might for a certain length
of time hold undisputed possession of the
Williamsburg district, and we counted on
being those conquerors.
</p>

<p>
It was not destined, however, that the
struggle in the Carolinas should be brought
to so speedy a conclusion.
</p>

<p>
Tarleton pursued our brigade, losing time
here and there to burn dwellings which
sheltered only women and children, until
he was come to within less than twelve
miles of our camp, when, to the surprise
of enemies as well as friends, he turned
suddenly about and marched with all
speed for Camden.
</p>

<p>
It was afterward said by the Tories that
Lord Cornwallis had expressly ordered
him to return; but more than one of us
believed then, and yet hold to it, that the
redcoated Britisher who could be so courageous
when he had none but old men,
boys and women in front of him, was absolutely
afraid to measure strength with
General Marion.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_220' name='Page_220'>[220]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Now while we laid here in safety,
gathering numbers every day, much was
done by our friends in other parts of the
colony.
</p>

<p>
General Sumter, our kinsman, gave
battle to Tarleton at the Blackstock farm
on the banks of the Tyger, defeating him
utterly, but at a terrific loss, so far as the
Cause was concerned. The Britishers had
ninety-two killed and one hundred and
four wounded. Among the Americans
only three were slain and four wounded;
but in the latter list was the general himself,
who bore as marks of the victory a
severely dangerous wound in the breast.
</p>

<p>
His gallant followers, true to him as
was our brigade to General Marion, lashed
him in the raw hide of a bullock which
was slung as a litter between two horses,
and thus, guarded by an hundred picked
men, he was carried to the upper colony,
so we were told, where he lay hovering
'twixt life and death.
</p>

<p>
It was also while we were encamped
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_221' name='Page_221'>[221]</a></span>
here that the battle of King's Mountain
was fought, when the British, under
Major Ferguson, were defeated handsomely,
the killed, wounded and captured
of the enemy amounting to eleven hundred
men, and among the dead was the
major himself.
</p>

<p>
Two exceedingly fortunate encounters
for us&mdash;encounters such as guaranteed
to us final victory if we could but hold
out as we had begun, and this seemed
most probable, for, as ever will be the
case, a successful commander finds plenty
of recruits.
</p>

<p>
We of Williamsburg were not inactive
during the days spent in camp; but made
forays here and there, capturing in some
places bands of Tories on their way to
Georgetown, or, having the good fortune
to come across detachments of the redcoats
who were guarding store-trains, until,
should I attempt to repeat all the little
adventures which befell us, I might continue
this writing until so many pages
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_222' name='Page_222'>[222]</a></span>
were filled that one would shrink from the
reading because of the magnitude of the
task.
</p>

<p>
It is with the more adventurous, but
yet the sadder part of our service under
General Marion that I must close this record
which has been intended only to show
what we comrades did, up to the time
Snow's Island was fortified, when we
ceased active operations during the year.
</p>

<p>
The British post at Georgetown was the
one place which our people most needed
as a base of operations against Charleston,
and, in fact, to hold our own in Williamsburg
district.
</p>

<p>
Situated as it was, we were constantly
menaced, wherever our brigade might be,
by the enemy holding possession of the
place. In addition to that, it was a depot
for supplies of salt, clothing and ammunition
for the king's troops, and of such
goods, we who fought for the Cause were
grievously in need.
</p>

<p>
To capture Georgetown would be an exploit
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_223' name='Page_223'>[223]</a></span>
such as might advantage our people
more than had the victory at King's Mountain,
therefore it was to this end that our
general proposed to bend all his energies,
and in the proposition he was seconded
ably by such followers as Major James and
Colonel Richardson, the last-named gentleman
having remained with us since the
day his home was destroyed.
</p>

<p>
It was believed that the enemy lay at
Georgetown in great force, perhaps to the
number of four thousand men, and we
knew full well the nature of the fortifications
round about the post.
</p>

<p>
A direct assault would have been fatal
to us. It was only by such methods as
had won for our general the name of
"Swamp Fox," that we could succeed, and,
as can well be fancied, none of our people
were averse to an attempt under those
circumstances, for we believed ourselves, so
far as backwoods strategy was concerned,
far superior to any of the king's forces.
</p>

<p>
The first we of the rank and file knew,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_224' name='Page_224'>[224]</a></span>
regarding the method by which it was hoped
we might succeed, was when we broke
camp, carrying with us all our equipage
and so much of provisions as could be
gathered from the country round about,
and crossed Black River to a little settlement
known as Potato Ferry, advancing
toward Georgetown by that road called the
"Gap Way."
</p>

<p>
Now this much by way of explanation
for the benefit of those who are not acquainted
with the vicinity of that post.
</p>

<p>
Three miles from Georgetown is an
inland swamp known as White's Bay,
which, discharging itself by two mouths,
the one into Black River and the other
into Sampit, completely cuts off the post,
which stands on the north side of the last-named
river near its junction with Winyaw
Bay. Over the creek which empties into
Sampit there is a bridge, two miles from
the town.
</p>

<p>
Now it was in the rear of this swamp
that we finally came to a halt, having, as
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_225' name='Page_225'>[225]</a></span>
was believed, arrived there without knowledge
of the enemy.
</p>

<p>
Gavin Witherspoon claimed that he understood
all which the general proposed to
do, but that statement I question seriously,
otherwise would we have heard from the
old man concerning several moves that
would have been more than injudicious if
General Marion had the same idea in mind
Gavin gave him credit for.
</p>

<p>
Let it be understood that we were come
to this point, not more than three miles
from the post, five hundred and fifty
strong, each one mounted and carrying
so much of provisions and provender as
would suffice for eight and forty hours' consumption.
</p>

<p>
Up to the moment of our halting we had
seen no persons save those whom we knew
beyond a peradventure to be devoted to
the Cause, and, therefore, could say to a
certainty that we were thus far advanced
toward the object of our desires in such
fashion as the Swamp Fox most desired.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_226' name='Page_226'>[226]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Unless some false move was made, some
prying, unfriendly eye discovered us, we
would be able to ride down upon Georgetown
as we had ridden into many a British
camp before, doing more through fear
than bullets, and gaining victory where
by rights none should have been enjoyed.
</p>

<p>
Well, we were halted here, and all had
dismounted, each man feeding his horse
in anticipation of the work to come when
the speed of the animals would avail as
much, perhaps even more than the accuracy
of our aim.
</p>

<p>
Then it was, after a consultation with
the general, my uncle advanced where all,
save that line of sentinels which hemmed
us in to keep prying eyes at a respectful
distance, might see him, and Gabriel
Marion said to me gleefully:
</p>

<p>
"Now has come the time, lad, when we
will be able to ride into this adventure side
by side, and carve out for ourselves such
names as shall live in the grateful memory
of men after these colonies are free."
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_227' name='Page_227'>[227]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
And the dear lad did carve out a name
for himself!
</p>

<p>
"I call for volunteers who will present
themselves for dangerous service," my uncle
began, and every man pricked up his
ears, each eager to be among those who
might distinguish themselves. "Two
squads of twenty each, and so many as are
minded to sacrifice their lives, perchance,
for the benefit of the brigade, may step
forward two paces."
</p>

<p>
Gavin, Percy, Gabriel and I advanced
without loss of time, and the blood fairly
leaped in my veins when I saw that of all
the brigade every man had made the same
movement.
</p>

<p>
In General Marion's force each was
equally eager to lay down his life for the
others, and it was that spirit which finally
gained for us the independence of the
American colonies.
</p>

<p>
"I had expected some such outburst of
patriotism; but failed by a considerable
degree to anticipate the reality," my uncle,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_228' name='Page_228'>[228]</a></span>
the major, said with a smile of satisfaction.
"You be brave lads all, as has been proven
many and many a time before, and therefore
each and every one is entitled to the
honor of making his life the sacrifice for
the others; but, unfortunately for your
desires, only forty men may be chosen.
Let those who are willing to relinquish the
desire to show their love for country in
order that others who, perhaps, can better
be spared may make any sacrifice, retreat
two paces."
</p>

<p>
Not a man moved; every trooper of the
Williamsburg brigade stood firm in place,
as if determined that he, and he alone,
should be the one who would give up his
life for the other, and among them all were
we four comrades, tried and true&mdash;comrades
who were destined to ride on until
we saw one of our number fall, foully murdered,
without being able to raise a hand
in his defense.
</p>

<p>
Now it was that General Marion advanced
to the side of my uncle, his eyes all
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_229' name='Page_229'>[229]</a></span>
aflame, and more enthusiasm showing in
that quiet face than I had ever believed
could find a place there.
</p>

<p>
"Gentlemen of the Williamsburg brigade,
I thank you from the bottom of my
heart. Many a time before have you
proven yourselves heroes; but never so
truly, never so emphatically as at this moment&mdash;when
every man of you is eager to
offer up his life, and in that for which the
volunteers are called I do assure you there
are eight chances out of ten that no one
comes back alive. Now I entreat that so
many of you as are fathers of families shall
step back, allowing younger soldiers to
take your places."
</p>

<p>
Yet every man remained in his place,
and it seemed much as though we might
come at loggerheads, one with the other,
as to who should die first, for all knew that
this attack upon the well-fortified, over-garrisoned
post of Georgetown was no
child's play, no feint at warfare; but a
desperate undertaking which to succeed
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_230' name='Page_230'>[230]</a></span>
must be carried on with total disregard of
life.
</p>

<p>
"Now has come the time when I myself
must make the selection," the major, my
uncle, said with a look on his face which
told how greatly this exhibition pleased
him. "I shall call out one man, and the
general may select another, each making
his choice until the forty have been chosen.
Let it be remembered that in this case I
exercise the right to use favoritism, for
there be among you lads of my own blood
whom I am minded shall go forth in preference
to those who have families dependent
upon them. Therefore, men, do not
blame me when I claim what I <i>may</i> claim,
even disregarding the privilege of others."
</p>

<p>
Then it was, and proud am I to write it,
that he cried out:
</p>

<p>
"Robert Sumter!"
</p>

<p>
I stepped forward, my face flushed with
pardonable pride, and in his turn the general
cried:
</p>

<p>
"Gabriel Marion!"
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_231' name='Page_231'>[231]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"Percy Sumter!" my uncle next called,
and the general added:
</p>

<p>
"Gavin Witherspoon!"
</p>

<p>
Thus were we four comrades the first to
be selected for this post of honor which will
be remembered, as I fondly believe, long
after we are gone from this world, and in
all the Carolinas were no four individuals
more puffed up with pride and pleasure
than we.
</p>

<p>
Around us everywhere were envious
eyes, as if life had suddenly lost all its
charm, and death were the one thing most
desired.
</p>

<p>
Man after man was thus summoned to
take his place in the ranks of the devoted,
until we had the full number two paces in
advance of all the rest, and then it was my
uncle said, moving up and down the line
as if it pleasured him to look on those who
were selected for the most perilous venture:
</p>

<p>
"Gentlemen, it may be that after another
hour has passed we shall not meet
again on this earth. Therefore I pray you,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_232' name='Page_232'>[232]</a></span>
those who have any request to make, speak
now, that we may remember in the days to
come that all you desired was granted."
</p>

<p>
No man spoke for so long a time as would
have taken me to count twenty, and then
Gabriel Marion, dear lad that he was, raised
his cap courteously, as he bowed and
said:
</p>

<p>
"Major James, if it so be the request we
make now be granted, I pray your pardon
when I ask a selfish one, which is that us
four who have been comrades since I joined
the brigade&mdash;us four who have eaten and
slept together, may not be separated when
you shall divide this squad into two. That
we may be allowed to go on side by side, as
we have from the day I first knew these
lads and Gavin Witherspoon."
</p>

<p>
"It shall be as you say," my uncle
replied, and then turning, looked at the
others.
</p>

<p>
Emboldened by Gabriel's speech, one
man requested that should he fail to return,
evidence might be sent his kinsmen that
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_233' name='Page_233'>[233]</a></span>
he was proud at being able to thus serve
the colonies.
</p>

<p>
Another made a similar request, and
so on until perhaps half a dozen had spoken,
when all fell silent.
</p>

<p>
There was no more to be said. It only
remained that we march forth to lay down
our lives, or to win them, as the case might
be.
</p>

<p>
As for myself, I believed we who were
chosen would probably perish in whatsoever
of adventure was before us, for I
thought then, much as did Gavin Witherspoon,
that we were to make an attack
upon two portions of the town, while the
remainder of the brigade, after we were
slain, would come in a different direction,
and, taking advantage of the diversion
caused by our attack, win the day.
</p>

<p>
It would be a glorious ending of one's
life; yet as I reflected upon it, although not
in the least degree wishing I might have
been among this third party rather than
in the lead, I said to myself that it would
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_234' name='Page_234'>[234]</a></span>
be sweet to live until we had thrown off
the king's yoke, for at this moment when
we stood face to face with death, almost
feeling the great white angel's cold hand
upon us, I was as certain we would finally
win the victory, however many hirelings
his majesty might send upon us, as I was
certain that my life might within a very
few moments be the penalty of the pride
which was within me.
</p>

<p>
Perchance never in the history of the
Carolinas has there at any one time so
much of true bravery been shown as we
saw then when the only discontent was
because one was more favored than another
in the permission to offer his life as
a sacrifice.
</p>

<p>
Well, we were not kept long in line after
such arrangements had been made as I
have described.
</p>

<p>
Before being dismissed, however, those
who were to be left behind would have
raised a cheer, but that Captain Horry prevented
any such outburst lest scouting
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_235' name='Page_235'>[235]</a></span>
parties of the enemy might be near, and
then the final preparations were made
without loss of time for the work in hand.
</p>

<p>
Captain Melton was named as the gentleman
who should lead our squad, and Captain
Horry given command of the other.
</p>

<p>
So far as his purpose was concerned,
General Marion did not leave us in doubt,
claiming, as he said, that we had the right
to know exactly what he proposed doing so
we might act the more intelligently.
</p>

<p>
Our squad was to approach the town
near White's Bridge, and the other would
reconnoiter on the opposite side of the
post; but neither was to return, save in
case of some serious disaster, until the
main attack had been made.
</p>

<p>
It was not exactly as Gavin Witherspoon
had predicted, because we were given no
orders to assault the enemy independently;
but were to make a detour, each squad
half around the post, and in case of any
important discovery to send word back immediately
to the general.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_236' name='Page_236'>[236]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
At the dawn of the following day the
brigade was to advance, and at the first
alarm, wherever we of the chosen ones
might be, we would join the assaulting
party in such manner as our commanders
thought proper.
</p>

<p>
All this, as I have said, was told by General
Marion himself, and nothing could
have given us greater confidence in the adventure
than that he should see fit to explain
his plans when another commander
might have remained silent.
</p>

<p>
There were no leave-takings; no delay.
</p>

<p>
Such work as ours was to be done on the
instant, and Captain Melton, advancing at
the head of our squad, for by this time we
had been told off in two parties of twenty,
said quietly:
</p>

<p>
"We will move on foot in such formation
as may be most agreeable. As I understand
it, our work is rather in the
nature of spying than of a military movement,
and my only order is that you allow
me to lead."
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_237' name='Page_237'>[237]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Captain Horry was already leaving the
encampment when we set off, following
our commander much as a party of pleasure
seekers might troop after him who
had promised to show them some desirable
place of entertainment, and as we threaded
our way through the swamp Gabriel
Marion, linking his arm in mine, said
cheerily, with never a tremor in his voice
to show that the doom of the future lay
upon his heart:
</p>

<p>
"We four are in rare luck, Robert Sumter.
I did not believe my uncle would
grant me so great a boon as to call my
name, and when yours was spoken by
Major James the tears almost came into
my eyes, fearing lest you should go while
I remained behind."
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_238' name='Page_238'>[238]</a></span>
</p>

<h2>
CHAPTER XI.<br />
<span class="s08">GABRIEL.</span></h2>

<p>
I know not how to set down properly
such a narrative as this, and, therefore,
should be excused for such mistakes as may
occur through ignorance and inexperience.
</p>

<p>
It is with the attack upon Georgetown
that I must end this portion of the adventures
which befell Percy and myself during
the time we served under General Marion,
and it may be the story should be continued
straight on without any heed whatsoever
to those who fought with us, although
in the same squad.
</p>

<p>
Whether it be right or wrong, I cannot
well neglect to speak of the part played
by that other party of twenty who volunteered
their lives as eagerly as did we who
followed Captain Melton, and what I write
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_239' name='Page_239'>[239]</a></span>
concerning them must, of course, be from
hearsay.
</p>

<p>
Therefore it seems to me proper to tell
first the story of Colonel Horry's squad,
as I have heard it related again and again,
before attempting to set down that which
I know of my own knowledge.
</p>

<p>
When the forty volunteers were divided
into two squads there was no time lost, as
I have already said, in setting forward
upon that mission which we believed could
be fully accomplished only through the
sacrifice of us all, and we parted at the
limits of the temporary halting place,
Captain Melton leading his force to the
right, while Colonel Horry began the reconnoiter
by bearing to the left.
</p>

<p>
As to what befell the first squad, this is
as I have heard it related:
</p>

<p>
They continued on through the woods
until near to daybreak, when, as Colonel
Horry himself has said, and I am now
quoting from his official account, he "laid
an ambuscade, with my twenty men, near
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_240' name='Page_240'>[240]</a></span>
the road. About sunrise a chair appeared
with two ladies escorted by two British
officers. I was ready in advance with an
officer to cut them off, but reflecting that
they might escape, and alarm the town,
which would prevent my taking greater
numbers, I desisted. The officers and chair
halted very near me, but soon the chair
went on, and the officers galloped into
the town. Our party continued in ambush
until 10 o'clock.
</p>

<p>
"Nothing appearing, and we having
eaten nothing for many hours, retired to
a plantation not far distant, where I knew
were to be found friends. As soon as I entered
the house four ladies appeared, two of
whom were Mrs. White and her daughter.
I was asked what I wanted. I answered,
food, refreshment. The other two ladies
were those whom I had seen escorted by
the British officers.
</p>

<p>
"The strange ladies seemed greatly
agitated, and begged most earnestly that
I would go away. I kept my eye on Mrs.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_241' name='Page_241'>[241]</a></span>
White, and saw she had a smiling countenance,
but said nothing. Soon she left the
room, and I left it also and went into the
piazza, laid my cap, sword and pistols on
the long bench, and walked the piazza;
when I discovered Mrs. White behind the
house chimney beckoning me.
</p>

<p>
"I got to her undiscovered by the young
ladies, when she said: 'Colonel Horry, be
on your guard; these two young ladies are
just from Georgetown; they are much
frightened, and I believe the British are
leaving it and may soon attack you. As
to provisions, I have plenty in yonder
barn, but you must affect to take them by
force.'
</p>

<p>
"I begged her to say no more, for I was
well acquainted with all such matters.
We both secretly returned, she to the room
where the young ladies were, and I to the
piazza I had just left."
</p>

<p>
The colonel had no more than gained
this point, when the sentinels gave an
alarm.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_242' name='Page_242'>[242]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Two musket-shots told him that an
enemy was near at hand, and almost immediately
afterward the firing became so
rapid that he knew an encounter was already
begun.
</p>

<p>
That brave officer thought only of his
men, and so nearly were the interests of
the squad allied, that he forgot all else save
the desire to be with them in the time of
danger.
</p>

<p>
He rushed into the fight, forgetting to
take with him even his saber&mdash;intent only
on being with those who had so well proven
their devotion to the Cause.
</p>

<p>
The British were seventeen in number,
well armed, and commanded by a brave
fellow named Merritt; but they were taken
by surprise.
</p>

<p>
The redcoats retreated, but turned in
their flight to strike a blow, and our men,
believing they had been ordered on even to
death, pursued with fatal earnestness.
</p>

<p>
Of the enemy's force only two men escaped
death or capture, and one of these
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_243' name='Page_243'>[243]</a></span>
was the captain, of whom Colonel Horry
writes:
</p>

<p>
"My men in succession came up with
Captain Merritt, who was in the rear of his
party, urging them forward. They engaged
him. He was a brave fellow. Baxter,
with pistols, fired at his breast, and
missing him, retired; Postell and Greene,
with swords, engaged him; both were
beaten off. Greene nearly lost his head.
His buckskin breeches were cut through
several inches. I almost blush to say that
this one British officer beat off three Americans.
Merritt escaped to a neighboring
swamp, from whence, at midnight, he got
to Georgetown."
</p>

<p>
I would it were possible for me to give
as brief an account, with as satisfactory
an ending, regarding our portion of the
reconnoiter.
</p>

<p>
As has been said, after crossing White's
Bridge the two squads separated, Colonel
Horry's going toward the left and ours to
the right.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_244' name='Page_244'>[244]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Then it was, as we rode on slowly,
mentally nerved for anything which might
happen and fully expecting sharp and
bloody work at any instant, that Gabriel
Marion said, looking first at Percy and
then at me:
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps it will never again be our good
fortune, comrades, to have such an opportunity
of proving our metal as has
come to us this night. Now I am in nowise
eager for death; but to my mind
there is little fear that the end be near at
hand. Although the odds are so strongly
against us, we shall take this post of
Georgetown, and I believe it because my
uncle, the major, is a careful, prudent soldier,
never taking upon himself chances
that are utterly without hope, although
many times the fact may have seemed to
be the reverse. We shall capture Georgetown,
comrades, and if either of us fails to
come out alive, we have the proud satisfaction
of knowing that whatsoever befalls
the Cause our names must live among
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_245' name='Page_245'>[245]</a></span>
those who volunteered everything for
freedom."
</p>

<p>
"I hold to it that this is not the time
for such speeches," Gavin Witherspoon
said nervously; and had I not known him
to be a man of tried courage I should have
said that at that moment he was afraid.
"These forty men who came forward so
gallantly understood full well in what
kind of an adventure they were engaged.
It does not prove that his courage is the
greatest who speaks overly much regarding
the future."
</p>

<p>
"Meaning by such speech, that I had
best hold my tongue," Gabriel said with a
laugh. "Perhaps you may be right, and
yet there is upon me the inclination to
speak of what we have ventured, in order
that I may be the better able to appreciate
life after it has been offered as a sacrifice
and refused."
</p>

<p>
"I guarantee that once we are come out
from this expedition, you will need no
thought of the past to make you understand
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_246' name='Page_246'>[246]</a></span>
that we rode down the very shadow
of death, when we crossed yonder bridge,
and this I say, not because there is in my
mind any foreknowledge of the future,
but from what I know regarding the
enemy. I realize, without being told, that
ours is as desperate an undertaking as
men can well imagine."
</p>

<p>
"I am thinking that your words, Gavin
Witherspoon, are as ill-timed as were
Gabriel's, for while he spoke of what might
be our reward, you are weighing, as it
were, the chances against us, and to my
mind it is not pleasant," Percy said with
an attempt at cheerfulness which I knew
full well was forced, and, stepping nearer
to the lad, I grasped his hand, an act
which, perhaps, gave him as much encouragement
as was in my mind to impart.
</p>

<p>
Gabriel continued to speak of the future,
as if he had no part in the present, until
word came that each man must hold himself
silent because we were come so near
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_247' name='Page_247'>[247]</a></span>
the town that there was good reason for
believing the enemy's sentinels might be
close at hand.
</p>

<p>
We straggled on, each as he pleased, although
there was some little show of military
formation. Captain Melton was allowed
to remain in the lead as he had
stipulated, but we four comrades took
good care not to fall back more than two
or three paces, for we were minded to
bear the brunt of the first encounter.
</p>

<p>
I had never before known what it was
to advance against an enemy on foot, and
the fact of being without a horse gave me
a certain sense of uneasiness.
</p>

<p>
So far as we of these two advanced
squads were concerned, there could be no
sudden dash; no spurring forward into
the very midst of the enemy. We must
fight our way forward slowly, and, as it
seemed to me, at a disadvantage.
</p>

<p>
However, it is true that my courage did
not fail me, although my hand trembled
with excitement, and my mouth was
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_248' name='Page_248'>[248]</a></span>
parched and dry as if I had been many
hours without water.
</p>

<p>
Gabriel had just thrown his arm over my
shoulder, to show the affection which was
in his heart for us all, when the thud of
horses' hoofs directly in the front told that
the enemy were on the alert.
</p>

<p>
Instantly we were halted, every man in
a posture of defense, and I venture to say
that there was not one among us who did
not wish he was in the saddle.
</p>

<p>
"Hold steady, boys!" Captain Melton
whispered. "Yonder comes the patrol,
and it may be they will turn before coming
as far as this; but if not, we have our
work cut out for us. The enemy must not
pass this point lest our friends in the rear
be discovered!"
</p>

<p>
Involuntarily we four had crouched
upon our knees in such position that we
could use the muskets to good advantage,
and thus we remained in the front line
while the horsemen galloped nearer and
nearer until they were absolutely upon us.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_249' name='Page_249'>[249]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"Fire!" our commander shouted, and
from that little squad of crouching figures
a line of fire flashed forth into the very
nostrils of the animals, causing them to
rear and plunge madly, thus diverting our
bullets from their targets.
</p>

<p>
Three saddles were emptied when a full
twenty would have been the result of the
volley had we fired one minute before, and
then every man among us began to reload
his weapon with feverish haste, for but
few seconds could elapse before the Britishers
would charge.
</p>

<p>
"This is what may be called a real battle!"
Gabriel cried exultantly; but no
one replied.
</p>

<p>
Death for many of us was close at hand,
and at such a time words do not come
readily.
</p>

<p>
I was ramming home the bullet in my
musket when the horsemen again dashed
upon us from out the darkness; there
came a roar as if a thousand guns had
been discharged at the same instant, and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_250' name='Page_250'>[250]</a></span>
all before me seemed to be a sheet of
flame.
</p>

<p>
Of what followed during the next five
or ten minutes I have no clear idea.
</p>

<p>
Before me reared and plunged the
British horses, while here, there and everywhere
I heard cries of rage or groans of
mortal agony until it was all a hideous,
whirling, dancing picture in which I could
distinguish only the outlines of my comrades,
who held their places bravely.
</p>

<p>
Side by side we fought against the redcoats,
ignorant of the fact that we were
alone, and then came the moment when
all our muskets were emptied at the same
instant.
</p>

<p>
The horsemen surrounded us; our weapons
were of little service against the sabers
of the enemy, and we understood it, although
there was no thought of surrender
in my mind until Gavin Witherspoon
seized me by the arm, shouting in my
ear:
</p>

<p>
"Surrender, lad, surrender! There is
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_251' name='Page_251'>[251]</a></span>
neither honor nor glory in dying when our
lives are of no avail for the Cause!"
</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i268" id="i268"></a>
<img src="images/i-268.jpg" width="340" height="550" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Gavin seized my arm, shouting in my ear: "Surrender, lad, surrender!"&mdash;<a href="#Page_250">Page 250</a>.
</p>
</div>
<p>
Even as he spoke three of the redcoats
had clutched Gabriel and Percy.
</p>

<p>
I allowed my musket, which had been
raised as a club, to drop, and immediately
I felt, for the first time, the grasp of a
Britisher.
</p>

<p>
We were prisoners. The glory of fighting
to the bitter end with the knowledge
that in so doing we were opening the way
for those in the rear, was denied us, and
but for the shame of it I could have wept
like a girl.
</p>

<p>
And yet all this was as nothing compared
with what followed.
</p>

<p>
The troopers were about to disarm us,
and some one had fired a torch that we
might be the better seen, when Sam
Lee&mdash;that miserable Tory and renegade&mdash;came
up from the rear, where most likely
he had been skulking during the fighting,
and, seeing us, set up a shout of
triumph.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_252' name='Page_252'>[252]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"Now have I got you rebels where
I've been burning to see you?" he cried.
</p>

<p>
"Now we shall see&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Is that Sam Lee?" Gabriel shouted,
struggling to release himself from his captor's
grasp.
</p>

<p>
"Ay, and it is the cur who has sold his
country, his kinsmen and himself for the
king's gold!" Percy replied. "There is no
dishonor in being overpowered by true soldiers
in a fair fight; but to have such as
that villain alive before one's eyes is a disgrace."
</p>

<p>
"It shall be worse than that to you!"
Sam shrieked, "and as for that nephew of
the rebel Marion, I&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"What are you saying?" one of the
troopers asked, seizing Sam Lee and shaking
him as if to force the reply more
quickly. "Is one of these a nephew to the
Swamp Fox?"
</p>

<p>
"Ay, that he is!" Gabriel made answer,
stepping forward as far as the hand of
the captor would permit. "I am the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_253' name='Page_253'>[253]</a></span>
nephew of General Marion, and proud indeed
of the kinship!"
</p>

<p>
I was looking at the dear lad that instant,
having turned my eyes from the
scurvy Tory when Gabriel began to speak,
otherwise, perhaps, I might have prevented
that terrible thing which followed.
</p>

<p>
While the remainder of the party were
looking at the brave lad who stood before
them in the glare of the torches, Sam Lee,
doubled-dyed villain that he was, rushed
upon him with a saber which he had
seized from the hand of the trooper.
</p>

<p>
In the flickering light I saw the gleam
of the steel, and before a word of warning
could escape my lips, the cruel weapon
descended, striking Gabriel full upon the
head, sheering its way downward until the
dear lad sank a lifeless mass at the feet of
that cur who was not worthy to so much
as kneel before him.
</p>

<p>
On the instant it was as if my eyes were
blinded by the crimson flood that followed
the stroke of the blade. There was a sensation
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_254' name='Page_254'>[254]</a></span>
as if all my blood was boiling, and,
for the time being, reason left me.
</p>

<p>
Gavin Witherspoon declares that I
wrenched myself free from the trooper who
held me, as if the Britisher had been no
more than a babe, that at the same instant
I leaped upon the Tory murderer, bearing
him to the earth till his face was sunk deep
in the blood-stained moss, and with the
same weapon which had let out the life of
the most gallant lad who ever lived, I
killed him.
</p>

<p>
It was done so quickly, Gavin declares,
that the redcoats had no time to interfere
before the work was accomplished, and
while they, horror-stricken as it were by
that which was not warfare in any sense
of the word, stood before us three&mdash;two
dead and one senseless, the remainder of
our squad fell upon them.
</p>

<p>
This last attack was successful; the
Britishers were beaten off, and our brave
fellows carried Gabriel's dear body, and
myself, back to the rear.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_255' name='Page_255'>[255]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
The attempt to capture Georgetown was
a failure, now that the enemy had been
warned, and our brigade beat a hasty

"The murder of Gabriel Marion, with
some other instances of brutality and
butchery on the part of the Tories, happening
about this time, gave a more savage
character than ever to the warfare which
ensued. Motives of private anger and personal
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_256' name='Page_256'>[256]</a></span>
revenge embittered and increased the
usual ferocities of civil war; and hundreds
of dreadful and desperate tragedies
caused the inhabitants to pursue each
other rather like wild beasts than like
men.
</p>

<p>
"In the Cheraw district, on the Pedee,
above the line where Marion commanded,
the warfare was one of utter extermination.
The revolutionary struggle in
Carolina was of a sort unknown in any
other part of the Union.
</p>

<p>
"The attempt upon Georgetown was defeated.
The British had taken the alarm,
and were now in strength, and in a state
of vigilance and activity which precluded
the possibility of surprise. Marion's
wishes, therefore, with regard to this place,
were deferred accordingly to a more auspicious
season.
</p>

<p>
"He retired to Snow's Island, where he
made his camp. It was peculiarly eligible
for his purposes, furnishing a secure retreat,
a depot for his arms, ammunition,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_257' name='Page_257'>[257]</a></span>
prisoners and invalids&mdash;difficult of access,
easily guarded, and contiguous to the
scenes of his most active operations.
</p>

<p>
"Snow's Island lies at the confluence of
Lynch's Creek and the Pedee. On the east
flows the latter river; on the west, Clark's
Creek, issuing from Lynch's and a stream
navigable for small vessels; on the north
lies Lynch's Creek, wide and deep, but
nearly choked by rafts of logs and refuse
timber. The island, high river swamp,
was spacious, and, like all the Pedee river
swamp of that day, abounded in live stock
and provision. Thick woods covered the
elevated tracts, dense cane-brakes the
lower, and here and there the eye rested
upon a cultivated spot, in maize, which the
invalids and convalescents were wont to
tend.
</p>

<p>
"Here Marion made his fortress. Having
secured all the boats of the neighborhood,
he chose such as he needed, and
destroyed the rest. Where the natural
defenses of the island seemed to require
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_258' name='Page_258'>[258]</a></span>
aid from art, he bestowed it; and, by cutting
away bridges and obstructing the
ordinary pathways with timber, he contrived
to insulate, as much as possible, the
country under his command.
</p>

<p>
"From this fortress his scouting parties
were sent forth nightly in all directions.
Enemies were always easy to be found.
The British maintained minor posts at
Nelson's Ferry and Scott's Lake, as well as
Georgetown; and the Tories on Lynch's
Creek and Little Pedee were much more
numerous, if less skilfully conducted, than
the men of Marion.
</p>

<p>
"Marion's encampment implied no repose,
no forbearance of the active business
of war. Very far from it. He was never
more dangerous to an enemy than when
he seemed quiet in camp.
</p>

<p>
"His camp, indeed, was frequently a
lure, by which to tempt the Tories into unseasonable
exposure. The post at Snow's
Island gave him particular facilities for
this species of warfare. He had but to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_259' name='Page_259'>[259]</a></span>
cross a river, and a three hours' march enabled
him to forage in an enemy's country.
</p>

<p>
"Reinforcements came to him daily, and
it was only now, for the first time, that his
command began to assume the appearance,
and exhibit the force of a brigade."

</p>

<p>
The period between the landing of Clive as a young writer in
India and the close of his career was critical and eventful in the
extreme. At its commencement the English were traders existing
on sufferance of the native princes. At its close they were masters
of Bengal and of the greater part of Southern India. The author

time, and battles and sieges follow each other in rapid succession,

which gives a lifelike interest to the volume.

In this story Mr. Henty gives the history of the first part of the

<p>
Boys reading the history of the Punic Wars have seldom a keen
appreciation of the merits of the contest. That it was at first a
struggle for empire, and afterward for existence on the part of
Carthage, that Hannibal was a great and skillful general, that he
defeated the Romans at Trebia, Lake Trasimenus, and Cannæ,
and all but took Rome, represents pretty nearly the sum total of
their knowledge. To let them know more about this momentous
struggle for the empire of the world Mr. Henty has written this

of a most interesting period of history, but is a tale of exciting
adventure sure to secure the interest of the reader.

<p>
In this story the author relates the stirring tale of the Scottish
War of Independence. The extraordinary valor and personal
prowess of Wallace and Bruce rival the deeds of the mythical
heroes of chivalry, and indeed at one time Wallace was ranked
with these legendary personages. The researches of modern
historians have shown, however, that he was a living, breathing
man&mdash;and a valiant champion. The hero of the tale fought under
both Wallace and Bruce, and while the strictest historical accuracy
has been maintained with respect to public events, the work is
full of "hairbreadth 'scapes" and wild adventure.

The story of a young Virginian planter, who, after bravely
proving his sympathy with the slaves of brutal masters, serves
with no less courage and enthusiasm under Lee and Jackson

<p>
The conquest of Mexico by a small band of resolute men under
the magnificent leadership of Cortez is always rightly ranked
among the most romantic and daring exploits in history. With
this as the groundwork of his story Mr. Henty has interwoven the
adventures of an English youth, Roger Hawkshaw, the sole survivor
of the good ship Swan, which had sailed from a Devon port
to challenge the mercantile supremacy of the Spaniards in the
New World. He is beset by many perils among the natives, but
is saved by his own judgment and strength, and by the devotion
of an Aztec princess. At last by a ruse he obtains the protection
of the Spaniards, and after the fall of Mexico he succeeds in regaining
his native shore, with a fortune and a charming Aztec
bride.

In the present volume Mr. Henty gives an account of the struggle
between Britain and France for supremacy in the North
American continent. On the issue of this war depended not only
the destinies of North America, but to a large extent those of the
mother countries themselves. The fall of Quebec decided that
the Anglo-Saxon race should predominate in the New World;
that Britain, and not France, should take the lead among the
nations of Europe; and that English and American commerce, the
English language, and English literature, should spread right
round the globe.

eyes&mdash;sinister-looking fellows who once on a time haunted the
Spanish Main, sneaking out from some hidden creek in their long,

<p>
Three Philadelphia boys, Seth Graydon "whose mother conducted
a boarding-house which was patronized by the British
officers;" Enoch Ball, "son of that Mrs. Ball whose dancing
school was situated on Letitia Street," and little Jacob, son of
"Chris, the Baker," serve as the principal characters. The
story is laid during the winter when Lord Howe held possession
of the city, and the lads aid the cause by assisting the American
spies who make regular and frequent visits from Valley Forge.
One reads here of home-life in the captive city when bread was
scarce among the people of the lower classes, and a reckless prodigality
shown by the British officers, who passed the winter in
feasting and merry-making while the members of the patriot army
but a few miles away were suffering from both cold and hunger.
The story abounds with pictures of Colonial life skillfully
drawn, and the glimpses of Washington's soldiers which are given
show that the work has not been hastily done, or without considerable
study.

<b>A Jaunt Through Java</b>: The Story of a Journey to the Sacred

<p>
The central interest of this story is found in the thrilling adventures
of two cousins, Hermon and Eustace Hadley, on their

In a land where the Royal Bengal tiger runs at large;
where the rhinoceros and other fierce beasts are to be met with

book should have a lively experience. Hermon not only distinguishes
himself by killing a full-grown tiger at short range,
but meets with the most startling adventure of the journey.

young fellows, bubbling over with boyish independence. They

<p>
A "down-east" plucky lad who ships as cabin boy, not from
love of adventure, but because it is the only course remaining by
which he can gain a livelihood. While in his bunk, seasick,
Ned Rogers hears the captain and mate discussing their plans for
the willful wreck of the brig in order to gain the insurance. Once
it is known he is in possession of the secret the captain maroons
him on Spider Island, explaining to the crew that the boy is
afflicted with leprosy. While thus involuntarily playing the part
of a Crusoe, Ned discovers a wreck submerged in the sand, and
overhauling the timbers for the purpose of gathering material
with which to build a hut finds a considerable amount of treasure.
Raising the wreck; a voyage to Havana under sail; shipping there
a crew and running for Savannah; the attempt of the crew to
seize the little craft after learning of the treasure on board, and,
as a matter of course, the successful ending of the journey, all
serve to make as entertaining a story of sea life as the most

This tale smacks of the salt sea. It is just the kind of story
that the majority of boys yearn for. From the moment that the
Sea Queen dispenses with the services of the tug in lower New
York bay till the breeze leaves her becalmed off the coast of
Florida, one can almost hear the whistle of the wind through her
rigging, the creak of her straining cordage as she heels to the
leeward, and feel her rise to the snow-capped waves which her
sharp bow cuts into twin streaks of foam. Off Marquesas Keys
she floats in a dead calm. Ben Clark, the hero of the story, and
Jake, the cook, spy a turtle asleep upon the glassy surface of the
water. They determine to capture him, and take a boat for that
purpose, and just as they succeed in catching him a thick fog
cuts them off from the vessel, and then their troubles begin.
They take refuge on board a drifting hulk, a storm arises and they
are cast ashore upon a low sandy key. Their adventures from
this point cannot fail to charm the reader. As a writer for young
people Mr. Otis is a prime favorite. His style is captivating, and
never for a moment does he allow the interest to flag. In "The

<p>
The two boys are from Portsmouth, N. H., and are introduced
in August, 1781, when on the point of leaving home to enlist in
Col. Scammell's regiment, then stationed near New York City.
Their method of traveling is on horseback, and the author has
given an interesting account of what was expected from boys in
the Colonial days. The lads, after no slight amount of adventure,
are sent as messengers&mdash;not soldiers&mdash;into the south to find the
troops under Lafayette. Once with that youthful general they
are given employment as spies, and enter the British camp,
bringing away valuable information. The pictures of camp-life
are carefully drawn, and the portrayal of Lafayette's character is
thoroughly well done. The story is wholesome in tone, as are all

a deceased Western merchant, and had been defrauded out of his
just rights by an unscrupulous uncle. The lad started for Cincinnati
to look up his heritage. But three years passed away
before he obtained his first clue. Mr. Grey, the uncle, did not
hesitate to employ a ruffian to kill the lad. The plan failed, and
Gilbert Grey, once Tom the bootblack, came into a comfortable
fortune. This is one of Mr. Alger's best stories.

<b>Captured by Zulus</b>: A story of Trapping in Africa. By <span class='smcap'>Harry
Prentice</span>. 12mo, cloth, price $1.00.
</p>

<p>
This story details the adventures of two lads, Dick Elsworth
and Bob Harvey, in the wilds of South Africa, for the purpose of
obtaining a supply of zoological curiosities. By stratagem the
Zulus capture Dick and Bob and take them to their principal
kraal or village. The lads escape death by digging their way
out of the prison hut by night. They are pursued, and after a
rough experience the boys eventually rejoin the expedition and
take part in several wild animal hunts. The Zulus finally give
up pursuit and the expedition arrives at the coast without further
trouble. Mr. Prentice has a delightful method of blending fact
with fiction. He tells exactly how wild-beast collectors secure
specimens on their native stamping grounds, and these descriptions
make very entertaining reading.

This is a dramatic narrative of the unaided rise of a fearless,
ambitious boy from the lowest round of fortune's ladder&mdash;the
gate of the poorhouse&mdash;to wealth and the governorship of his
native State. Thomas Seacomb begins life with a purpose. While

jealousy and craft seek to blast his promising future. Later he
sets out to obtain a charter for a railroad line in connection with
the express business. Now he realizes what it is to match himself
against capital. Yet he wins and the railroad is built. Only
an uncommon nature like Tom's could successfully oppose such a
combine. How he manages to win the battle is told by Mr. Hill
in a masterful way that thrills the reader and holds his attention

<b>The Young Scout</b>; The Story of a West Point Lieutenant. By

</p>

<p>
The crafty Apache chief Geronimo but a few years ago was the
most terrible scourge of the southwest border. The author has
woven, in a tale of thrilling interest, all the incidents of Geronimo's
last raid. The hero is Lieutenant James Decker, a recent graduate
of West Point. Ambitious to distinguish himself so as to win
well-deserved promotion, the young man takes many a desperate
chance against the enemy and on more than one occasion narrowly
escapes with his life. The story naturally abounds in
thrilling situations, and being historically correct, it is reasonable
to believe it will find great favor with the boys. In our opinion
Mr. Ellis is the best writer of Indian stories now before the
public.

Without a doubt Joe Mason was a lucky boy, but he deserved
the golden chances that fell to his lot, for he had the pluck and
ambition to push himself to the front. Joe had but one dollar in
the world when he stood despondently on the California Mail
Steamship Co.'s dock in New York watching the preparations incident

still Joe's entire capital when he landed in the bustling town of
tents and one-story cabins&mdash;the San Francisco of '51, and inside
of the week the boy was proprietor of a small restaurant earning a
comfortable profit. The story is chock full of stirring incidents,
while the amusing situations are furnished by Joshua Bickford,
from Pumpkin Hollow, and the fellow who modestly styles himself
the "Rip-tail Roarer, from Pike Co., Missouri." Mr. Alger

In this series of historical stories each one is
complete in itself, yet taken together they form
one of the most entertaining histories of the Revolution.
The utmost care has been exercised to
have them historically correct, and so much of
romance as is used to make the tales stirring is
subordinated to the facts. They have been written
with the distinct purpose of portraying the
struggle for liberty in romantic form, and while
being in the highest degree interesting stories for
the young, are at the same time especially instructive,
inasmuch as the greatest possible
amount of information is given.
